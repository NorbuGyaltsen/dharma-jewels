There are two types of posture. One is more elaborate and the other is simple. In total, there are two.\nI will tell you the simple one first. The most important thing is to keep your spine straight all the way to your head. Keeping the spine straight means keeping it naturally straight. Normally, our spine is a little bit curved. That is okay. It is a natural curve. So, keep it loosely straight. I will give you an example of this. Maybe we will try it together. Not keeping the spine straight is like this (Mingyur Rinpoche hunches over with his back rounded.) You can try to meditate this way. The body becomes crunched and folded. That is not really comfortable, right?&nbsp;\nNow, maybe try to be too tight and too straight, like this (YMR stiffens.) Try that. (YMR laughs) This is too tight.\nWhat you have to do is opening your shoulders (inhales and exhales deeply.) Just open and relax your muscles. Relax means just letting them be, naturally. You can put your hands on your knees. Keep the spine straight all the way to the head. Not like this or like that (flops head side to side.) That is the first point. The second point is to relax your whole body. There are only these two points. This is the simple version.\nIn the elaborate one, there are seven points. First with the legs: if you sit on a cushion, then cross your legs. You can cross your legs using any style, in this way (crosses his legs) or one leg outside and one leg inside – half-crossed legs. If you are sitting on a chair, then touch both feet to the ground. That is also okay. This is the first point.&nbsp;\nThe second point is the hands. You can join both your hands and put them on your lap. Sometimes this can become a little bit hot, or create a feeling of moisture. If you want to change position, then put your hands on your knees or cover your knees. That is the second point relating to the hands.\nThe third point is the arms and shoulders. Open and relax your shoulders, and do not tighten your arms. Just let them be loose and relaxed.&nbsp;\nNumber four is the spine. Keep the spine loosely straight.\nNumber five is the neck. Bend your neck a little bit forward, almost like the weight of your head rests on your neck. Not tight, but loose, so you can turn right and left.&nbsp;\nNumber six is connected with the mouth. You can open your mouth just slightly and breathe through your nose or mouth. It does not matter. Some texts say you need to touch the tip of your tongue to your palate. But if you do not do this, it is also okay. Another choice is to close your mouth.\nThe last point, number seven, is the eyes. In the beginning, when you first begin to meditate, you close your eyes. You simply close them. Just like when you go to sleep, you just close your eyes, right? You do not have to squeeze them shut. Just close them naturally. As you get some meditation experience, you can begin to slowly open your eyes. Just let them be open normally. You do not need to control the blinking of your eyes. Sometimes you can look a little bit down, sometimes straight, and sometimes a little bit up. You can change the direction of your gaze.&nbsp;\nSo altogether, there are seven points. Do not worry too much about having perfect posture. The most important points are keeping your spine loosely straight and relaxing your whole body. Relax means letting it be, naturally. These two are important. With the seven points, as you practice meditation more and more, you can discover the balance of the body posture. If you have back pain or something like that, then you can use a support for your back, like a chair or a pillow or something to support your back is also fine.\nNow, the body posture is finished.\nWatch Read\nNow we will practice our first meditation technique, which is awareness of the body.\nI would like you to raise your hand like this [Mingyur Rinpoche raises one of his hands near his face]. Of course, you know you are raising your hand, right? So that is awareness. Now please see if you feel any temperature in your hand—pleasant, unpleasant, or cool, heat, whatever sensation. If you feel cool, if you know it is cool, that is awareness. If warm, you know the warmth, that is awareness. Or if you don't feel anything, you're just aware that you don't feel anything, that is also awareness—awareness of your hand.&nbsp;\nMaybe now, you may feel pain here [Mingyur Rinpoche indicates his shoulder] because you are raising your hand, right? So be aware of that pain. Now let your hand down. You may feel relief, a pleasant sensation. Be aware of that. So, it doesn't matter if it's pleasant or unpleasant. It doesn't matter if it's cool or hot. It doesn't matter if there's no particular sensation—just neutral is okay, or no sensation is also okay.&nbsp;\nNow, we are going to observe the sensations in our body from head to feet—scan the body. So we will do this together. First, please keep your spine straight—loosely straight, there's no need to be too straight. Sit comfortably. You can put your hands on your knees; that's also okay. Relax. Now&nbsp;please close your eyes.&nbsp;\nPlease feel any sensation in your forehead—pleasant, unpleasant, tingling, or no sensation—it doesn't matter.&nbsp;\nNow, move from the forehead to the top of the head. Just be aware of it. It doesn't matter what kind of sensation there is, or if there's no sensation.&nbsp;\nNow, move from the top of the head to the back of the head. Relax the muscles in the back of the head. Be aware of sensations.&nbsp;\nNow, move your awareness to your face. Relax the muscles in your face. Just let it be. Be aware of sensations in your face.\nNow the neck, shoulders—the right and left shoulder. Relax your shoulders. Be aware of sensations.\nNow, move to the back—from the upper back to the lower back. Relax your back.&nbsp;\nNow the chest. Be aware of sensations in your chest.&nbsp;\nNow the stomach. Don't squeeze the muscles in your stomach. Just relax. Be aware of sensations.&nbsp;\nNow the arms—right and left arm.&nbsp;\nAnd the legs...\nNow, feel your entire body, from head to feet. Just relax and allow whatever sensation that is present. Don't control the sensation. Don't try to make a particularly pleasant sensation. Just be free, be yourself, and allow, give permission, to let sensations pass, arise, and let it be in awareness. The sensations are in awareness—they come in awareness, stay in awareness, and dissolves back into awareness.&nbsp;\nNow, please open your eyes. Okay, it's finished now. How was it?\nWhen you meditate in this way, you are not really judging. You are not doing anything. You just allow all these sensations in your body. You welcome them and let them arise, stay, and dissolve. You also don't have to say, \"Don't judge.\" If judgment comes, allow judgment. If you don't know how to relax, that is also okay—allow that non-relaxing, allow that tightness. If you allow that non-relaxing, you are relaxing.&nbsp;\nAwareness is like space, and sensations—pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral—are like the entire universe. And space allows everything, right? Like a star shooting out and exploring the planet—space doesn't feel, \"Oh, my favorite star is gone,\" or, \"This star is beautiful! I love this star! But I hate that star.\" Space doesn't care, but everything is allowed in the space. Space is like the background of everything. So when you practice like that, awareness becomes the background of everything, and you are not judging, you are not controlling, you are not suppressing. Everything is completely free, and your mind is present with awareness. Awareness is always there; awareness is free, awareness is pure, genuine, and always present.&nbsp;\nThank you! 5 minutes of formal meditation every day\n35 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 2 days of practice (Streak = consecutive days of practice)\nInquiry\nHow is awareness similar to space?\nMeditating with Body Sensations\nBegin session Begin by checking in with your posture. Find a comfortable posture, keeping the spine upright, and let the body be relaxed and at ease. Main practice Next, bring awareness to the top of the head, simply noticing any sensation that is present. Continue this body scan by bringing awareness to the forehead, eyes, nose, jaw, etc., all the way down to the feet and toes.\nIt is completely natural for the mind to wander off and get lost in thoughts or emotions. When this happens, simply bring your awareness back to the sensations in your body.\nNext, notice the body as a whole.\nThen, bring awareness to sensations, wherever they might be in your body. There might be pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations. Whatever you are experiencing is okay; just know what you are sensing. End session Before ending this practice, take a moment to appreciate taking the opportunity to spend this time meditating.\nAs you end your formal meditation session, see whether you can continue to have a gentle awareness of the sensations in your body as you begin to move around.\nRemember that you can come back to this practice for short moments anytime throughout the day. When doing the body scan, are there things you are noticing in your body that you were not aware of before?How did you experience the instruction to simply allow any sensation to be present in your body, even if it was unpleasant, without trying to change it in any way?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusion, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.1 Finding Happiness Within Application\" data-href=\"1.1.1 Finding Happiness Within Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.1-finding-happiness-within-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.1 Finding Happiness Within, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","1.1.1 finding happiness within, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","1.1.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with the Body (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_the_Body_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Body Posture</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Body_Posture*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with the Body</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_the_Body*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.1-finding-happiness-within-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.1-finding-happiness-within-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473842,"modifiedTime":1759272585048,"sourceSize":10991,"sourcePath":"1.

We are going to explore meditation. Meditation is a step-by-step practice. The purpose of meditation is twofold. The first is to find happiness within. Normally, we are all looking for happiness in our lives. We try so many things—we try to get new experiences, to achieve different goals—so many things. But the real, lasting happiness that we can find is not in the outside circumstances; it is within.\nWhen I was young, I was not happy. I was a little bit of a sensitive person, and I had panic attacks. When something was a little bit wrong, I felt unhappy for many days. When something was right, I felt really happy. So, it was kind of like I was always depending on something, always looking for some kind of stimulation to be happy. But then I had a great opportunity in that my father was a great meditation teacher, so I learned meditation from my father. He told me that real, lasting happiness is within.\nHappiness can be found in your mind if you know how to work with your mind. We will teach you this step-by-step practice of how to work with the mind, how to free the mind, and especially how we have this really great gift that we call \"awareness.\" Awareness is really the natural quality of our minds. This awareness is free and pure; this awareness is peaceful; and this awareness also has a variety of different qualities like love, compassion, wisdom, and capabilities. So a lot of good things are there within us—within you, within me.\nWhen I was young, of course, the first time I heard this from my father, I did not believe it! I thought, \"Oh, my father is just sweet-talking. I'm a very young boy, and he is just trying to make me feel better,\" because my mind was a little bit sensitive. But as I have practiced more and learned more, I have had this real discovery. \"Ah-ha! This awareness is really great, and all these great qualities are there within me.\" It is really fascinating to have this discovery.\nThe second purpose is, of course, the first is finding happiness within, through awareness, compassion, and wisdom—through all these aspects—but the second is then to try to manifest this from the inside out. Although you have found happiness within, if you are looking for peace only on the inside, then when you look around—when you are facing a difficult situation in your life, or when you are facing obstacles in your life—you don't know what to do. All this becomes a source of suffering if you always sit on the cushion and meditate with the idea of \"Peace…\" Don't do that!\nEventually, the traditional meditation teachings teach us how to transform everything as support for meditation—transform form, sound, smell, taste, sensation, thought, and even emotion. We have this monkey mind, but even the monkey mind becomes support for your meditation, like a friend. I meditated, and through meditation, I transformed my panic into my support, my friend, my teacher. Normally, I say that my panic was my teacher, and I miss my panic! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I will tell you more in detail about this, so do not be over-excited. It is a step-by-step practice.\nThese two ideas are: find real happiness inside and to transform everything as support for happiness, for awareness, and for meditation. These are the two important things. They are kind of like our goals. But then, how do we practice this? First, we recognize awareness. Then there is a variety of different meditation techniques. We have many, many different meditation techniques. We have these five senses, right? We can use whatever we experience through the five senses, or in the mind with thought and emotion. So there are many meditation techniques. It's good that when we go to the shopping mall, we have so many different choices, right? Even when you go to eat pizza—pizza with this, vegetarian or non-vegetarian, with this flavor—there are so many choices. In the restaurant, if I order one dish, they ask me to make so many choices that sometimes I'm confused!\nWe do not want to confuse you a lot with all these meditation techniques, but having many choices has two benefits. One is that it can suit your personality. Everybody has a different personality. One meditation technique is not suitable for all different personalities or mentalities. So, among these, you can find one that works for you, and you have to start with that. The second is that, even if you find the best meditation for you, if you practice this again and again, after some time you'll feel bored. Even if you like pizza, and it's the best pizza, if breakfast is a pizza, and lunch is a pizza, and dinner is a pizza, and the next day... [Mingyur Rinpoche chuckles]. Then after a few days, you feel bored, right? \"Gosh, pizza again.\" So, with meditation, it is also the same. Even though you've found the best meditation for you, after some time you feel bored, and you need to change it. If you change like that, then eventually you will find that awareness becomes more clear, more profound, and deeper. Everything becomes a support for you at the same time. So, there are a lot of benefits—it's like \"buy one, get many free!\"\nWe hope this course will benefit you. These teachings really helped me transform my life and change my life. I hope they will bring benefits to you, too.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nWhat would it mean to transform an experience into meditation, as Mingyur Rinpoche teaches? Can you think of an example and explore how meditation might change the experience?\nPoints to remember:\nThe two purposes of awareness meditation: finding happiness within\ntransforming everything into support for meditation The qualities of awareness: love and compassion\nwisdom\ncapability The two benefits of using different meditation techniques: it suits different personalities\nit keeps meditation fresh and clear Awareness is the natural quality of your mind.\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe essence of meditation\nthe meaning of awareness\nthe key to happiness\ncommon misunderstandings about meditation\nWatch Read\nThe essence of meditation is awareness. So, what is awareness? Awareness is knowing—knowing what you are thinking, experiencing, seeing, hearing, knowing what you are doing—all of this is awareness. Right now, you are watching this video, right? Do you know you are watching this video? If you know you are watching this video, that is awareness. And you know you are sitting, probably, when you watch this video for the meditation. You might be sitting on a cushion or chair, right? Do you know that? If you know, that is awareness. That's it! It is very simple—just knowing.&nbsp;\nTo recognize this awareness is really important. This will be the key to meditation—what we call the essence of meditation. Also, recognizing awareness will be the key to happiness, the key to freedom, for freeing your mind—it is very important. Many people think meditation is to think of nothing, or concentration, or looking for a particular state of mind like peace or joy. It is not like that. It is all about connecting with awareness.\nNow, I will give you an examination of whether you recognize awareness or not. [Mingyur Rinpoche chuckles.] This exam has three questions. So, whatever your level of understanding is, just give the answer. Don't think too much.&nbsp;\nThe first question is, how many of you (even if you are by yourself) think you recognize awareness now? Raise your hand. The second question: If you think you do not recognize awareness, that you do not know awareness, raise your hand.&nbsp;\n[The third question:] If you think you don't know—you are confused, \"I maybe recognize awareness, maybe not\"—if you are feeling confused, raise your hand.&nbsp;\nOkay, great! Now I will give you the result of the examination. The result is that you all passed! Do you understand why you all passed? Maybe you are kind of shocked. \"There were three questions and all of us passed. Why?\"&nbsp;\nOf course, for those who said, \"Yes, I know awareness,\" you know awareness. You are aware of that. You all passed. But for those who said, \"I don't know awareness,\" do you know that you don't know? If you know you don't know, that means you know! You are aware. You are aware that you don't know, so that is awareness. You recognize awareness, so you passed. And for those who said, \"I'm not sure,\" do you know you are not sure? If you know you are not sure, that's also recognizing awareness. So actually, you all passed. Great! Congratulations! [Mingyur Rinpoche applauds.]\nThis is really important. You all recognized awareness, so now we are going to practice meditation. Meditation is all about recognizing awareness and maintaining that recognition—that is meditation.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nHow would you describe the essence of meditation to a friend?\nPoints to remember:\nThe essence of meditation is awareness.\nAwareness means \"to know\".\nThe key to happiness is recognizing awareness.\nCommon misunderstandings about meditation are that it means: to be free of thoughts.\nto have strong concentration.\nto achieve a particular state of mind, like being peaceful or blissful.

Sometimes I walked for seven or eight days. But then I would stay in one place to do retreat for a few months, so there was not much movement. Sometimes I went outside the cave to do some exercise. I developed an exercise that I call awareness yoga.\nSo we will do one simple exercise. There are a few of them, and we will do a simple one.\nHow do you do this one? It is almost like you are swimming. You need to snap your arms like this [Mingyur Rinpoche demonstrates the movement.] At the same time, you have to breathe out—breathe like this [Mingyur Rinpoche exhales forcefully through his nose and gestures to his belly to show where the breath comes from.]\nAgain snap [demonstrates arm movements again.] Okay. Great.\nNow, your hands move like if you were swimming [Mingyur Rinpoche moves his hands and arms like swimming breaststroke.] When you snap, you have to stretch your fingers [Mingyur Rinpoche spreads his fingers of both hands very straight, then he demonstrates combining swimming motion with snapping arms back to sides and spreading fingers.]\nNow together [Mingyur Rinpoche reaches his arms forward then back in a swimming motion, then snaps them back to his sides while exhaling forcefully.] It does not matter if your hands are this way, or that way—do not worry about being perfect. Just something like this, okay?\nSo now we are going to do this together; snap and breath out together a few times, okay? [Mingyur Rinpoche performs the movements while breathing through his nose for about 30 seconds].\nNow, take a deep breath in. Let go from the mouth.\nNow, be aware of sensations in your body. Please close your eyes. Breathe normally. Whatever sensation comes in your body, just be aware of it. There are sensations from head to feet. Do not control, do not suppress. Just let it be. [Mingyur Rinpoche sits quietly for a few moments].\nThe experience, when you do this yoga, afterward your mind becomes calm and the body feels relaxed. Normally, we have a lot of stress, a lot of thoughts and emotions going on in our head. So this becomes calmer. At the same time, the experience is relaxed. You feel relaxed and a well-being that you cannot really describe—sometimes we call it \"child mind\" or \"joy of youth.\" Children, when they experience joy, they cannot put it into words but, at the same time, they can experience it. So the experience sometimes comes like that, but it does not matter what kind of experience there is. Also, do not look in particular for that \"child mind\" experience or \"joy of youth\"—all these things. You do not have to particularly look for that. It comes automatically—just be with that, and do not try to control, do not try to create anything. Just let everything be in awareness, okay. 5 minutes of formal meditation every day\n35 minutes in total for this section.\nA streak of 2 days of practice\nDefinition\nChild mind:\nAn event that can be experienced but not expressed in words. Like a child in a museum looking at the art or a mute person tasting candy.\nMeditating with Awareness and the Body\nBegin session Find a posture that allows you to be both alert and aware and, most importantly, relaxed and at ease.\nKeeping your eyes open or closed, take a few moments to notice any sensations that are present in your body. Main practice Move your awareness to your body and see whether you can find any unpleasant sensations.\nThe point here is not to try to change the experience, but just to notice what the experience is like, with awareness, openness, and curiosity.\nContinue to explore the sensations in your body. Can you find a more pleasant sensation? Again, just notice with a sense of openness what this sensation feels like.\nNext, find a place in your body where there is no strong sensation at all—the so-called \"neutral\" sensation. Simply rest your awareness in this part of your body, and explore your experience.\nNext, continue to explore the sensations in your body. Can you bring a sense of unconditional acceptance to whatever you experience?\nLet this exploration be effortless, without blocking thoughts or experiences. Just notice what is happening in the present moment. When you get distracted, that is fine. Simply come back and continue where you left off.\nFrom time to time, drop the exploration and rest in open awareness for a few moments. End session Gently open your eyes if they have been closed, and take in the world around you. Notice what you hear and what you see. How did relating to unpleasant sensations with awareness change the way you experienced them? How about pleasant sensations? Did awareness change the way you experienced them?Were you able to bring a sense of unconditional acceptance to sensations, even if only for a brief moment?

Of course, when we meditate, we need to find a balance. First I would like to give you a demonstration. I will do a drama so you can see by example what is too tight and too loose and finding balance between the two.&nbsp;\nSo, if you want to drink this water [Mingyur Rinpoche gestures to a glass of water], there are three ways to drink it. The first is like this [Mingyur Rinpoche tightens his body, arms, and face]: \"OK, I need to drink this water!\" You tighten your hand and arm and your entire body, and you try to get the cup. You get tired. That is the first style.\nThe second style is [Mingyur Rinpoche adopts a very relaxed posture]: \"Ah, you know, I need to drink this water, so now I am going to get this water [Mingyur Rinpoche yawns and sighs], and tomorrow I will drink it.\" Then tomorrow: \"Oh yes, I am going to drink the water—but where is my smartphone?\" Then maybe you look at the phone, and see how many \"likes\" you have, and forget: \"Oh, the water!\" That's the second style.\nThe third style is to relax your hand, grab the cup, and drink the water [Mingyur Rinpoche demonstrates]. Mmm, good!\nSo, which one do you like? Do you like the first one, the second one, or the third one? Raise your hand. I think you are raising your hand for the third one, right? Normally people raise their hands for the third one because the third one has balance. The first one is too tight, the second one is too loose. The third one is relaxed and balanced. You grab the cup. It's very nice.\nWe like it, but whether we are doing it or not—that's another issue. We might like it, but we might not do it. Sometimes what we do is become too tight. When they meditate, some people are very tight [Mingyur Rinpoche adopts the tight posture and voice]: \"Concentration! I need a special kind of mind! I need to empty my mind—no thought, no emotion! Absolute concentration on my breath, on sound, on sensation!\" If you do that, then the thoughts will come more and more and grow louder. But sometimes you are just loose: \"I'm going to meditate, maybe tomorrow...\" And even if you meditate, you are just wandering here and there, and then there's no result.\nWhat we do to find a balance in meditation is to try our best. Use your effort, your skill, whatever energy you have, but don't make your mind too tight on the result, because sometimes you have a good result in your meditation, sometimes not. The meditation experience goes up and down, up and down—just like the stock market, just like the waves of the ocean—up and down. So accept that, but don't give up. What we call \"letting go\" is not giving up. Letting go means you accept that life is like the stock market, up and down. Meditation experience is also like the stock market and goes up and down. You accept that, but at the same time you don't give up. You try your best. If you do that, then you have balance.\nThis is true not only of meditation but of anything we do in our life, say, in the workplace or in a relationship or in the particular business we do. Maybe we are helping people, helping society, doing social work. Maybe we are studying or taking an exam. If we have balance, then the effects of what we do become greater, we are more relaxed, and we can easily achieve even difficult tasks. Therefore, finding balance is really important.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche says \"Try your best and do not focus too much on the results.\" Why should we not focus too much on the results of our meditation?\nPoints to remember:\nThe three styles of meditation: too tight\ntoo loose\nbalanced Meditation experience goes up and down.\nLetting go is not giving up.\nThe most effective approach to meditation is to try your best without focusing too much on the results.\nWhen there is balance, results come more easily.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\na great analogy for not being too tight or too loose.\nabout the natural function of the mind and how to work with it.\nabout nonjudgmental awareness.

Normally, after a long time meditating, doing walking meditation really helps. Especially, if you sit too long, when you walk it feels really good.&nbsp;\nI went to the Himalayan mountains to do retreat. Sometimes, I would sit too long. Then I would come out of my cave or the retreat house — sometimes I would get a small house — and I would walk.\nWhile walking, you can be aware of the movements of your body. The feet walking: right, left. You can be aware of that. Or just be aware of any sensation in your body. Also, when you walk, the air touches your body. There is a cooling sensation, or sometimes a warm sensation, or sometimes a tactile sensation. Anything that happens in your body, any experience in your body, just be aware of it and continue to walk. You just walk naturally. You do not need to walk very slowly. You do not need to walk very fast. Be natural and just walk, mind and body together. When doing awareness of the body practice, you sit still and bring awareness into the body. You can do the same thing while walking. Bring the mind into the body. Mind and body together.\nThis walking meditation is really beneficial. It especially helps to integrate meditation in everyday life. Sometimes you can meditate in everyday life, while you are walking or in different places, but it can be quite difficult that suddenly you can meditate like that. Sitting meditation is quite easy. Walking meditation is sometimes a little bit more difficult than sitting, but not chaotic like everyday life. It is in between. So it really benefits the conjunction between sitting and everyday life.\nSo, this is finished now! 10 minutes of formal meditation every day\n70 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 3 days of practice\nTip\nAs you walk down the street, simply feel the sensation of your feet touching the ground.\nWalking Meditation\nBegin session Begin by just standing for a moment. As you are standing, sense how awareness is permeating your entire body; there is a knowing quality that extends to the sensations in your body. Main practice Next, begin walking normally with your eyes open, and simply be aware of the sensations in your body as you walk. You can be aware of your feet touching the ground or any other place in your body where sensations are prominent.\nThere is no need to focus very hard. All you need is a light touch of awareness of whatever sensations are present.\nDo not block any other experiences that are taking place as you are walking. Simply let the awareness rest with sensations as you walk.\nIt is completely natural to get lost in sights or sounds as you are walking. Just recognize that this is happening, and gently bring awareness back to the sensations in your body during movement.\nBring an attitude of playfulness to this practice, noticing how the mind is present, then gets lost, and then comes back, over and over.\nDuring this practice, there might be pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sensations. All three equally support the recognition of awareness. End session As you reach the end of your walking meditation, stop for a moment and notice the sensations in your body as you stand. Also, appreciate the time you have taken out of your day to engage in this practice. How did this practice change your experience of the simple act of walking?What does walking meditation offer to your meditation practice in addition to sitting practice? Did this change your understanding of meditation?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

This advertisement was for a phone brand. If you use this brand of SIM card, the advertisement said, \"You can use this everywhere, anytime, even in the mountains.\" I thought, \"This is a good advertisement for meditation.\" So, I changed it a little bit. \"You can meditate everywhere, anytime, even in the city.\"\nMany people think that meditation means you have to look for nice conditions, a perfect place that is not busy, then sit very quietly. Actually, this is not necessary. Of course, if you can find those places and it really helps you, that is great! But, even if not, you can meditate while you are walking, talking, or eating. You can meditate in your office, at work, in the car, or on the train, everywhere. And anytime: morning, afternoon, evening. You can meditate anytime.\nWhen you meditate, it is just for a short time. Maybe for a few seconds, then you forget. Again you come back for a few seconds, then you forget. When I was young, I really liked the idea of meditation, but I did not like the practice of meditation. I felt bored. I would sit. I would think I was meditating for thirty minutes, but actually, it was ten minutes or five minutes, and then I would yawn. Sometimes I would fall asleep. Then, I would stand up, walk around, go to the woods. I liked to hike in the mountains. While I was walking, I would meditate—get lost, and come back, get lost and come back. This is really beneficial—short times, many times.\nYou do not really have to worry about posture, either. Sevenfold posture, twofold posture—do not worry. Everywhere, anytime, and under any circumstances. This way also really helps to enhance meditation. Especially, if you do this again and again, then after some time this becomes a habit. It comes naturally. Then, even if you feel stress, even if you are facing problems, the mind automatically goes to meditation. This is really helpful for these situations, for stress, for panic. Also at your office—if you are thinking, if you are making plans, if you really want to concentrate on strategy, structure, or whatever—apply this meditation. Your mind rests in meditation for a little bit, then you can think. Again rest, then think. That is good for thinking.\nFor me, if I want to make plans or whatever, from time to time, I meditate. It helps. It helps your thinking capacity, the capacity to think clearly. It also helps meditation. It helps both. If you think too much at once, your mind gets tired, your brain is tired. Then afterward, some time later, you cannot think well. You need to rest, also. Rest and think.\nThis practice of meditating everywhere, anytime, even for a short time, really benefits me, and I hope it benefits you too.\nThank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nHow can we meditate anywhere, anytime as Mingyur Rinpoche suggests?

Reflect on whom you will see over the next few days, and pick a specific interaction you can use for this practice. You can practice with anyone: a spouse, friend, child, or anyone else you will meet. When you're with this person, give them your full attention. Don't overly focus on the person's voice; just hold a gentle awareness as you listen, without blocking other aspects of experience. It will be helpful to pick a specific place and time of the day when you will apply this practice.Journal Reflection Question 1When you give the other person your full attention while they are talking to you, what effect does that have on the interaction?Journal Reflection Question 2When letting the other person's voice be the initial trigger for recognizing awareness, do you notice any differences in how the conversation goes?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.4 the Waterfall of Thoughts Summary\" data-href=\"1.1.4 the Waterfall of Thoughts Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.4-the-waterfall-of-thoughts-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.4 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(5_min)_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"},{"heading":"Step 3","level":3,"id":"Step_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.4-the-waterfall-of-thoughts-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.4-the-waterfall-of-thoughts-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473000,"modifiedTime":1759272585162,"sourceSize":1783,"sourcePath":"1.

Normally, we always have to start with what is easy, right? People like pleasant sound, I hope. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nNow, we are going to practice this together. First, please keep your meditation posture, and please close your eyes. Relax the muscles in your body, and feel the sensation in your body.\n[Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.]\nOkay, now please listen to this pleasant sound.\n[Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.]\nJust listen. Let sound come to your ears. Whatever sound is out there, all these sounds have to come through your ears, so you don't have to worry. Just open your ears and whatever sound comes, just listen to it. 10 minutes of formal meditation every day\n70 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 3 days of practice\nMeditating with Pleasant Sound\nBegin session Find a posture that supports being aware and alert as well as relaxed and at ease.\nTake a moment to simply notice what is going on in your body. If there is some tension in certain places, just be aware of this. Sometimes, by merely bringing awareness to these places they naturally relax, and if they do not, that is fine, too.\nNext, let go of all the \"doing\" energy of your mind, and give yourself permission to simply be. Rest naturally with whatever is happening right now. It does not matter what state of mind you are in; what matters is awareness itself—being aware of what is going on inside you and around you in this very moment. Main practice You may want to close your eyes for this practice, but you can keep your eyes open if it feels more natural to do so.\nYou may also want to listen to some pleasant music or some other sounds that you enjoy.\nBring awareness to whatever sounds are present right now. Use whatever you are hearing as the support for awareness. You do not need to focus or concentrate on these sounds, but just listen with awareness, as though you are hearing the most beautiful piece of music you have ever heard.\nAs you listen, see if you can infuse the act of hearing with warmth and curiosity. Again, it does not take any effort or striving to listen. Just notice whatever you are hearing with a sense of exploration and curiosity.\nLet go of listening, and just rest naturally in open awareness for a few moments. Simply be.\nOnce again, return to the sound meditation, letting it be the support for awareness.\nContinue to alternate using sound as the support for meditation with simply resting in the present moment, letting everything be as it is. End session If your eyes have been closed, you can gently open them, and just be for a few moments. Rest naturally, without doing anything, in the present moment. How did listening to pleasant sounds with awareness change your experience of listening? Did you notice anything different from what you might notice in a normal moment of listening to something you find pleasant and enjoyable?Have you tried doing this practice with both closed and open eyes? If so, do you experience the practice differently when having the eyes closed versus open?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.4 the Waterfall of Thoughts Application\" data-href=\"1.1.4 the Waterfall of Thoughts Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.4-the-waterfall-of-thoughts-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Pleasant Sound (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Pleasant_Sound_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Pleasant Sound</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Pleasant_Sound*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.4-the-waterfall-of-thoughts-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.4-the-waterfall-of-thoughts-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473702,"modifiedTime":1759272585176,"sourceSize":4205,"sourcePath":"1.

In the beginning, maybe you feel quite nice, but then after that, you see so many thoughts pop up. Emotions, thoughts—\"Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada, yada.\" You feel like, \"Oh! Before I learned meditation, I didn't have so many thoughts like that, so now what's happened?\"&nbsp;\nIt happened to me, when I was young. When I would meditate, at first I didn't understand what meditation was, so I tried to sit and meditate. I felt a little bit dizzy the first time I learned meditation. I felt like my cushion was moving, you know? So I asked my father to teach me meditation again. Then I had an experience where I felt quite happy—really happy. A feeling of being really happy came from inside. It felt a little bit like love, like joy. I was really inspired by that because my father told me that happiness is within. So, even when I was playing with my friends, I was not looking for—I liked to eat this sugar [sweet candy] when I was young—tiny sugar squares. Now, even with no sugar, I felt happy! It was quite a surprise.\nBut then, the next day, this wonderful experience was gone. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Then what I felt was, \"I'm looking for that happiness, but not finding that feeling of peace and happiness.\" My mind became like a flag in the wind. In my hometown, we have a lot of flags, and we have a lot of wind sometimes. The wind is blowing the flags. My mind became like that—so many thoughts and a lot of things going on.\nI explained this to my father, and my father told me an example. In Nepal and India, we have monsoons; in Tibet we also have monsoons. During the monsoon, when you go to the river, the river has become muddy. So when you look at the river, you cannot see anything inside the river. After the monsoon season has stopped, when you go to the same river and look in the river, the river has become more clean, pure, and calm. Then you start to see so many things in the river. There is a lot of fish inside the river. In my hometown, there is some kind of small fish and they are moving around [Mingyur Rinpoche moves his hands].\nMy father said that even though you go to the same river, you might wonder the second time, \"Wow! So many fish are here. Where did they come from?\" But actually, the fish are there during the monsoon season, but in the monsoon season, the river becomes muddy so you cannot see the fish. Now, the water has become calm, clean, and pure, so you begin to see the fish.\nMy father said it is the same when you meditate. In the beginning, you have a lot of thoughts, but you don't recognize that. You are just one with thoughts and emotions. But now when you start to meditate, your mind becomes more calm and clear. Slowly, slowly, you will recognize a lot of thoughts, emotions, and things like that. Actually, this is a good sign.\nSo if you meditate and you feel like you are getting worse, you have more thoughts and more emotions than before—great! It is a good sign. You should be happy about that! \"Wow, I feel worse than before!\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Seriously, it is not a problem. It is what we traditionally call the \"waterfall experience,\" the first stage of meditation. A lot of thoughts and emotions come rushing in. In fact, it is good.\nSo, I would like to share this with you. Many people nowadays misunderstand meditation. They think meditation means to think of nothing—no thoughts, no emotions. When you first meditate, you will begin to recognize this. Then you feel like something is wrong with your meditation, or something is wrong with the instructions, or \"Something is wrong with me. Maybe I have no connection with meditation,\" or something like that. But actually that is totally wrong. That's a good sign, the first sign that your mind is beginning to become calm and peaceful. So you should be happy about that.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nIf a friend who just started meditating came to you and explained that he or she was more distracted than before, how would you explain that this is actually a good sign?\nPoints to remember:\nWaterfall experience means that you feel like you are experiencing more thoughts and emotions than before beginning to meditate.\nFeeling like you are getting worse when beginning to meditate is a good sign.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nthe waterfall experience.\ncommon reactions to this experience.\nhow Mingyur Rinpoche's teachers instructed him to deal with the waterfall experience.

You do not need a particular sound, like always needing to meditate with the sound of a ringing bell. So, maybe I should do some magic. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I will present you some different sounds that you can listen to, okay?&nbsp;\nThe first magic is… [Mingyur Rinpoche clicks his fingers and we hear the sound of children playing.] Can you hear that? Listen! When you listen, that is sound meditation.\nAnother one—I will present you with a different sound. [Mingyur Rinpoche clicks his fingers and we hear the sound of ocean waves.] Be aware of it.\nAnd another one—this one might be very exciting, okay? One, two, three… [Mingyur Rinpoche clicks his fingers and we hear the sound of howling wind.] Be aware of it.\nNow, I have become a magician [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nSo let us try this together. Please keep your meditation posture. First, close your eyes, and scan your body gently from head to feet.\nOkay, now, listen to the sound. [Mingyur Rinpoche clicks his fingers and we hear the sound of many people talking.] Just be aware of it.\n[Mingyur Rinpoche clicks his fingers and we hear a bird calling.] This is a different sound. It does not matter, just continue to listen.\n[Mingyur Rinpoche clicks his fingers and there are hospital sounds with a beeping monitor.] Yet, another sound. And when you hear this sound, the flavor that comes with this sound is different. Sometimes you feel a little bit happy or not so happy. You want to listen to it or you do not want to listen to it. It does not matter. Let all these thoughts and emotions pass. Let them come, and let them go. You just listen to the sounds.\nOkay. How was it?\nNormally, when you listen to different sounds, they may bring you different thoughts and feelings. But it is okay! Whatever state your mind is in, let it be. The most important thing is to not forget the sound. As long as you do not forget the sound, then if the image of a party comes, or the image of ocean and waves, or the birds in the mountains, or pizza—let them come and let them go. Awareness is always there. It is always present. Thoughts and emotions cannot change awareness. Pleasant and unpleasant emotions cannot change awareness. The same is true for virtue and non-virtue. Awareness is always pure and present.\nMaybe I should give you an example. I went on a retreat in the Himalayan Mountains for a few years. One time I went hiking. I had been in my cave for many days, and I felt a little bit bored. So I thought, \"Maybe I need exercise.\" So, I hiked behind my cave. The mountain was like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche holds one palm like a steep mountain slope and walks his fingers up it.] I hiked, and when I reached the top there was another mountain behind it. There was a very nice view! So, I went up, up, up, and the view became even nicer. There were fewer trees, and the mountain became more open. Then I saw a lake. It was very nice! Sometimes I drank fresh water. So, I drank a little bit, the water temperature was very cold but it tasted sweet. When I looked at the lake, it seemed so clean! It was kind of like pristine. I felt very happy! The weather was really nice, so I continued to hike, going up. Suddenly, some clouds came, and the weather changed, so I thought, \"Okay, maybe I should go back to my cave.\" So I came down, and when I came down, I saw the same lake again but now the lake had completely changed—it had like a muddy, gray, dark color. I was a little surprised, \"Oh, what happened with that lake? I already drank that water.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Then I went down further and looked more closely. The water was still pristine and clean. Then I recognized, \"Ah-ha!\" I looked up and knew it was because of the clouds.\nIn the morning, there were no clouds so the lake was completely clear and pristine, but when I came back there were clouds. The color of the clouds made the lake look completely gray but, actually, the lake did not change. The water was clean and pristine, but because of the weather, it looked like the lake had changed color.\nAwareness is like this lake, and these thoughts, emotions, sensations, sounds—good sounds, not nice sounds, music, chatter—all these are just like clouds. You just let everything come, be with it, and when it dissolves, you let it dissolve. Doing this is really good.\nI hope this will benefit you. This time, we tried to practice with many different kinds of sound. I hope this brings you a deeper experience of sound meditation.\nThank you! 10 minutes of formal meditation every day\n70 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 3 days of practice\nTip\nRemember! The type of sound is not important; knowing that you are hearing the sound is important.\nMeditating with Neutral Sound\nBegin session Begin by sitting in a comfortable posture, letting the body be relaxed and at ease.\nTake a few moments to let awareness settle in the body, just noticing any sensations that are present.&nbsp; Main practice Next, be aware of any sounds that are present. Notice how sounds arise, remain for a moment, and then disappear. There is no need to try to hang on to any specific sounds or disregard others. Simply embrace the sounds with a gentle touch of awareness.\nWhen images, thoughts, or emotions occur in the mind, there is no need to block them; instead, allow them to accompany the sound, noticing how they can be present in awareness along with the sounds.\nThere is no need to focus strongly on a particular sound, but simply know that you are hearing—the knowing is meditation.\nNotice how awareness can accommodate any sound, without your having to do anything.&nbsp;\nIt is normal for your mind to wander off. Whenever you get lost, simply come back to being aware of the sounds in your surroundings. &nbsp; End session Before ending the practice, take a moment to appreciate that you are capable of hearing. Appreciate that you have awareness and that you are taking time to familiarize yourself with this ever-present awareness. How did this practice change your experience of hearing and listening? In what way was it different from, or the same as an ordinary experience of hearing a sound?How was this practice different from using pleasant sounds alone as support for your meditation? What effect did this have on your experience?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.5 It's All About Awareness Application\" data-href=\"1.1.5 It's All About Awareness Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.5-it's-all-about-awareness-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.5 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Neutral Sound (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Neutral_Sound_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Neutral Sound</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Neutral_Sound*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.5-it's-all-about-awareness-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.5-it's-all-about-awareness-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473659,"modifiedTime":1759272585220,"sourceSize":7451,"sourcePath":"1.

The first time that I learned meditation, I did not know that. I thought that the object was more important. I was struggling, my mind was fixed on the breath, fixed on sound, but later, my father said:\n\"The object, whether the physical sensation,\nSound, breath, or whatever,\nIs just a support for awareness.\nThe essence of meditation is awareness.\"\nI felt relieved.\nYou know awareness, right? We discussed this before. Awareness means knowing. Our mind has a special quality, which is the knowingness that knows what you are thinking or feeling. This cognition, the awareness, is with you all the time. It is with you 24 hours a day, even while you are sleeping. Sometimes, we call these \"unconscious moments,\" such as sleeping without dreaming, drinking too much alcohol and being drunk, or the moment of dying, or fainting; even in these, there is still awareness.\nAwareness is the basis of all of this. You have awareness 24 hours a day, and this awareness is the essence of meditation. There is some kind of contradiction here. You have awareness 24 hours a day, and awareness is the essence of meditation, but you are not meditating 24 hours a day. Why is this?\nEven before you learn meditation, you have awareness, but you are not meditating. You do not even know what meditation is, but still, awareness is the essence of meditation. Why? There is a contradiction here. I want you to discuss this if you are with a friend, or in a group. If you are alone, you can think about it for a few minutes, okay? Now, you can pause my video for a few minutes, just pause it, okay?\nOkay, how was it? What is the answer? Of course, I cannot hear your answer. I do not know what your answer is, but maybe I should tell you the answer. The answer is... the recognition.\nYou have awareness, but if you do not recognize your own awareness, then that does not become meditation. In that case, the quality of awareness cannot manifest for you; you cannot experience it. Although awareness is free, pure, present, genuine, peaceful, and has all these good qualities, if we do not recognize awareness, then we are stuck in thoughts, emotions, or perceptions.\nFor example, do you know what this is? It is a watch. What is the quality of a watch? It tells the time, right? If you have a watch, but do not recognize your own watch, even though the watch has the quality to tell you the time, if you do not recognize your watch, then there is no benefit. The watch cannot tell you the time.\nEven if awareness is really perfect, if you are not connected with awareness, if you do not recognize it, there is no benefit. When you recognize awareness, whenever you meditate the object automatically becomes the support for your awareness.\nWhen you are aware of your bodily sensations, once you have recognized awareness, and you know that this bodily sensation is the support for awareness, then you automatically recognize awareness. You do not have to worry too much about \"Where is awareness? I only see the body.\" There is no need to worry too much because it is automatic because of your view, meaning you understand awareness, and you want to meditate, that is the motivation. These two, the view and motivation will change your meditation experience.\nThis is really important. Therefore, by doing that, what happens is that it really helps our mind to become more familiar with awareness, and then become more familiar with the quality of mind. The thoughts and emotions can come and go in awareness. We will not be lost in thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. Our mind becomes freer.\nNormally, we are lost in thoughts and emotions. If we are not connected with awareness, then in our minds we only have thoughts and emotions; it is always talking, and there are a lot of things. This is what we call, \"monkey mind.\"\nThis monkey mind is always active, always looking for stimulation. It is very restless, with a lot of energy. It cannot remain peaceful and calm. If there is nothing to do, then the mind feels a little bit of fear, the monkey mind feels fear: \"I do not have a job, soon I will become jobless! Then maybe I will become homeless. I have to do something!\"\nThen, what we normally do is to hate the monkey mind. When I was young, I hated my panic. So the panic of panic was stronger than the panic itself. Or if you do not like stress, you do not like these negative emotions, the thoughts, the voice in your head, then you hate that. If you try to stop it or try to fight it, then the monkey mind becomes your enemy, which is not good.\nBut sometimes, we listen to the monkey mind. The monkey mind says, \"Oh, do something, do something new, every day. Oh, you are bored? Then you should do this.\" Then we try something else, and then, in the end, we feel bored again. We try to look for yet another stimulation in our life, maybe a new relationship, maybe we go to the mall and buy a lot of things. Even though you cannot use them, your closet is full of clothes, or you buy pizza, go sightseeing, or change your job. So many things we listen to, and then sometimes, this voice is very negative. It criticizes you, others, the world. Then, if you believe that, and say, \"Yes, sir. Yes, sir,\" then the monkey mind becomes your boss, and it is not a good boss, but a bad one.\nThe boss is crazy, and then you also become crazy. If you fight with the monkey mind, then the monkey mind becomes your enemy. If you listen to the monkey mind, it becomes your boss. Both cases are not so nice.\nWhat should we do? Actually, there is a third choice. The third choice is to make friends with the monkey mind. If you make friends with the monkey mind, then the monkey mind actually becomes quite useful. The monkey mind is not bad.\nThe key point is how to make friends with the monkey mind. Just giving a banana does not work. You have to know the secret. The secret is... What does the monkey mind like? A job. It is restless, right?\nWhat you like is freedom. You do not want to become a slave of the monkey mind. You do not want to become the enemy of the monkey mind. You just want to be free and calm. How do you do that? The key point is that you need to give a job to the monkey mind. That is the secret.\nIf you can give a job to the monkey mind, then the monkey mind will be very happy, because the monkey mind loves jobs. Now, who has become the boss? You became the boss because you gave a job to the monkey mind, and so you are free. You are no longer controlled by the monkey mind. Now, the monkey mind becomes your employee, and you become its employer.\nBut do not give a full-time professional job to monkey mind at the beginning. In the beginning, you need to give the monkey mind a part-time job. What is a part-time job? Ask the monkey mind, \"Hello, listen to the sound\" or \"Watch the sensation in the body.\" And the monkey mind replies, \"Oh yeah. Good idea! Sound…\" and it forgets.\nDo not punish the monkey mind. Just say \"That is okay, no problem. Do it again.\" And the monkey mind says, \"Oh yes! Sorry, sorry. Sensation…\" and it forgets again. If you do this again and again, then the monkey mind forms a new habit. It will like to listen to you more and more, and then you become freer. This is how meditation works.\nTherefore, meditation does not only make our mind calm and peaceful but also pliable and workable. That is the benefit of meditation.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nIf awareness is present all the time, and the essence of meditation is awareness, why are you not always meditating?\nPoints to remember:\nAwareness is with you all the time.\nthe object of meditation is not important. What is important is awareness.\nMake friends with the monkey mind by giving it a job.\nDo not punish the monkey mind when forgetting awareness, but keep offering it a job.\nMeditation makes the mind calm and peaceful, as well as pliable and workable.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nto use sound as the support for meditation.\nthe meaning of the term \"self-antidote\".\nthe benefits of meditating on sound.\na traditional Indian story about sound meditation.

Until now, you have practiced meditation with pleasant or neutral sounds. Now, we are going to move a little bit further and practice with unpleasant sound. Why? Because the most important part of this practice is transforming everything into your friend. We already started to make friends with sensations in the body—now we will do it with sounds.&nbsp;\nIt is easy to make friends with pleasant sound but unpleasant sound is quite difficult. But that is okay. Normally, we need to start with something easy first. If you cannot transform unpleasant sounds into support for your meditation right now, do not worry—there is no problem. You do not have to worry, \"I should transform everything as support for my meditation. This is the practice. If I cannot transform unpleasant sounds that means I do not understand meditation.\" It is not like that, because the level of meditation experience has to grow slowly, okay? It is like going to the gym. First, you have to exercise with light things. You cannot lift up heavy objects, right? First, you have to start with two or three kgs, not twenty or forty kgs—it is impossible. Meditation is similar. Eventually, you can transform. Do not worry. Be patient. We have to start by going step by step. Today we will practice with one unpleasant sound.\nNow we are going to practice together. By the way, do you know how to meditate with unpleasant sound? Do you know or not? If you know, raise your hand. If you do not know, raise your hand. Okay, I do not know for which answer you raise your hand. If you raised your hand for not knowing, actually you know—but maybe you do not know that you know. Should I tell you what I mean? Or maybe I will give you a hint, a tip, okay? The essence of meditation is awareness, right? So now you know how to meditate with unpleasant sounds, right? I think you know now. Be aware of the unpleasant sound. That is all! Although it looks like I am teaching you many meditation teachings, actually, there is only one technique, and that is awareness. But then you have awareness with sound, with sensation, with what you see, hear, smell, with different things, and they all become meditation. It is very easy!\nAre you ready? Fasten seatbelts! Please keep your spine loosely straight, and please close your eyes. Now bring your mind to the body. Relax your body. Scan your body from head to feet. [Mingyur Rinpoche sits quietly for a few moments].\nNow please listen to sound [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers, then sits quietly and listens to different sounds.]\nOkay. How was it? Exciting or irritating? It depends on the sound, right? Of course. This was a taste of unpleasant sounds. If you feel like you can be aware and be with the sound, then even unpleasant sounds become support for your meditation. You make friends with unpleasant sounds. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n105 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 4 days of practice\nInquiry\nDoes how you relate to unpleasant sound change when you apply awareness?\nMeditating with Unpleasant Sound\nBegin session Find a comfortable posture that leaves your body relaxed and at ease and your mind aware and alert.&nbsp;\nNotice what is going on in your body. Simply be aware of any sensations that are present.\nTake a few moments to connect with your breath, noticing each inhalation and exhalation. Let your mind and body relax and connect more deeply with each exhalation.\nBefore turning your awareness to sound, take a moment to just be. There is no need to do anything. Simply be present and aware. &nbsp; Main practice You might want to close your eyes for this practice. Of course, if you find it more natural to keep your eyes open, you are welcome to do so.&nbsp;\nGently bring your awareness to whatever sounds are present in your environment right now. Even if the sounds are unpleasant, see whether you can just let them in and be aware of them.\nRemember that the point here is awareness. What is important is not the type of sound, but how you relate to the sound. There is no need to focus or concentrate too much; just bring a gentle touch of awareness to whatever sounds are present right now.&nbsp;\nWhenever your mind wanders off, just notice this and gently bring it back to awareness of sound.&nbsp;\nLet go of the listening for a few moments and simply be, resting naturally in awareness. Once again, bring your awareness back to sound and just listen with mindful awareness.\nContinue to alternate between listening to sound and simply resting naturally in awareness, leaving everything just as it is. End session Gently open your eyes if they have been closed, and just take in whatever you are seeing, together with whatever sounds are present. Rest here for a few moments before leaving your meditation seat. What did you notice in this practice, compared with the practice of using pleasant or neutral sounds as support for meditation?Is there anything in particular that is challenging about practicing with unpleasant sounds? Is there anything that is particularly rewarding?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.6 Non-Meditation Non-Distraction Application\" data-href=\"1.1.6 Non-Meditation Non-Distraction Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.6-non-meditation-non-distraction-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.6 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Unpleasant Sound</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Unpleasant_Sound*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.6-non-meditation-non-distraction-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.6-non-meditation-non-distraction-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473621,"modifiedTime":1759272585260,"sourceSize":6212,"sourcePath":"1.

The first step we are going to try is sound meditation.\nThe first step is to listen to sound. I want you to just listen to the sound now. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps a Tibetan singing bowl several times, pausing to listen to the ringing each time.] Can you hear the sound? [Mingyur Rinpoche taps the bowl again.] If you can hear the sound, raise your hand. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps again.] I think you hear the sound, right? So, that's finished. It's very easy—just hear the sound.\nThe second step we are going to do is sound meditation. The instructions for this are: please keep your spine loosely straight, and close your eyes. Now what we have to do is concentrate on the sound. Not on any other thoughts—no pizza—just listen to the sound clearly and concentrate. Now, please close your eyes and only focus on the sound. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps the singing bowl.] Keep clear and focus on the sound [taps bowl]. Don't let your mind wander here and there [taps bowl a few more times].\nHow was it? Which one is easier? The first is to just listen to the sound, not sound meditation; and the second is sound meditation. If you feel the first one is easier, raise your hand. [Mingyur Rinpoche looks as if to view raised hands.] Okay. If you think the second one—the sound meditation—is easier, raise your hand [looks again as if to see the show of hands]. Okay, I think you raised your hand, right? [Rinpoche chuckles.] I see. No, I cannot see, but normally what happens is that most people raise their hand on the first one, just listening to sound. Of course, that is easy. \"I can hear sound.\" That is all. The second one, sound meditation, is not so easy.\nNow, I will tell you one of the big secrets, which is that the real meditation is the first one. Just listen to sound: that is meditation. The second one is a little bit too tight. I made you a little bit too tight because I asked you to focus and not let your mind wander here and there.\nNormally, we don't need that. Just like the first step, you just listen to sound and then whatever thoughts come, let them come and let them go. If you don't forget the sound, you're okay.\nLet's try it together. Now, we're going to practice again, and this time just the first style—just the ears and mind working together, listening to sound. As long as you hear the sound, then thoughts, emotions, or experiences—whatever comes—it's okay. Let them come, let them go; don't block them, okay?\nPlease keep your spine loosely straight. Please close your eyes. Now, please listen to the sound [slowly taps bowl five times]. Just simply be aware of the sound. Relax, don't worry about thoughts, emotions, pictures, voices. Let them come, let them go [taps bowl], be completely natural [taps bowl].\nOkay. How was it?\nThis is sound meditation; actually, we say \"in real meditation you don't have to meditate.\" Sometimes we say \"non-meditation is the best meditation.\" You just simply be aware of sound; that's all. There's no particular meditation—you don't have to focus or visualize, or create a special state of mind—nothing.\nThis is just the natural way. Not meditating, but you don't get lost since your mind stays with the sound. As long as you continue to hear the sound, awareness is there, so you don't get lost. Therefore, we sometimes say, \"non-meditation, but without getting lost.\" These two come together automatically.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow is non-meditation different from not meditating at all? Question 2\nHow would you explain non-meditation to someone who suggests that meditation takes a lot of attention, concentration, and effort? Points to remember:\nNon-meditation is the best meditation.\nDon't meditate, and don't get lost.\nIn real meditation, you don't have to meditate.\nThe only obstacle to meditation is that it is too easy.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nmore about non-meditation.\nhow to recognize ordinary mind.\nwhy it can be difficult to recognize how easy meditation really is.

This is Tim. I am happy to have the chance to introduce this next section—section seven of our Calming the Mind course. And this section is called&nbsp;Short Times, Many Times.\nIn this section, Mingyur Rinpoche is going to show us how to become connected—or to stay connected—with meditative awareness at any time. This is a simple and elegant instruction, but one that continues to break down the barrier between the formality of meditating on the cushion and access to awareness throughout the day.\nThe wonderful thing about this is that since awareness is our very nature, we can come back to it at any time. This is the beauty of working with meditation and awareness in everyday life—it is always right there to come back to. Since awareness is our very nature, we can never be separated from it. It is often said that awareness is so close to us that it is like a fly on the bridge of our nose—sometimes we cannot see it. And it is so easy, we do not trust it.&nbsp;\nPart of this lesson for me, over the years, has been to encourage me to trust the fact that awareness is always right at hand. That no matter what is happening—good or bad, however crazy things might get—the continuous thread of awareness, this knowingness, this simple quality of presence, is always available for us. It is always available for us to touch right back into. And, all along, that simple sense of presence and the qualities that abide within awareness are similarly available—the qualities of loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom.&nbsp;\nIn many ways, as we move along the path of meditation many things will happen on the cushion. Things that might seem wonderful. Things that might seem disturbing. But that is not the main point. The main point—and this comes later, or over time—will be that we will have a sense—a simple sense—of presence, knowingness, of this awareness being available to us at any time.\nWith that simple availability, similarly again, the qualities that are there, the qualities that this offers us, the qualities of stability—stability, because awareness never changes. So, stability is there. Flexibility is present to us at all times. The quality of balance is present to us at all times. The quality of connection is available to us at all times. And, beautifully, warmth and kindness are always there. So, again, no matter how we might get spun out in our life, how difficult things might become, this quality of simple presence, this simple presence of awareness, is always right there.\nBeing able to have this quality of trust in us—that at any time awareness is there, that at any time we can come back. Come back home. Come back to who we really are. Come back to the qualities that are inherent in us being human. This builds our trust. It builds our confidence in ourselves. And, similarly, as trust develops in ourselves, we can then further relax. And as we further relax, naturally that sense of presence is there. And as we further relax we, interestingly enough, further open up and open out into the world. This awareness manifests as a quality of connection with others, a connection with the world, and a connection that, again, is replete with warmth and care. It is so beautiful! This is the power, again, of meditation.\nSo I hope you enjoy this section and, as always, I encourage you to take part in the forum to share your questions, observations, and your experiences. We are coming towards the end of this particular module. I hope you have enjoyed it, and we will talk again soon.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.7 Short Times Many Times View\" data-href=\"1.1.7 Short Times Many Times View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.7-short-times-many-times-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.7 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Short Times, Many Times (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Short_Times,_Many_Times_(5_min)_0"},{"heading":"Introduction by Tim Olmsted","level":3,"id":"Introduction_by_Tim_Olmsted_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.7-short-times-many-times-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.7-short-times-many-times-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473589,"modifiedTime":1759272585294,"sourceSize":4305,"sourcePath":"1.

Meditation practice has two main purposes. The first one is to connect with our fundamental nature. We have this wonderful nature. Our true nature is like the sky, whereas our thoughts, emotions, and perceptions are like clouds. Another example is that our true nature is like the ocean, and whatever thoughts, emotions or perceptions we experience, are like the waves of the ocean.\nThe main problem is that we do not see our true nature. Although our true nature is perfect, wonderful, and amazing, we do not feel like we are amazing. Our true nature is completely free, but we do not feel like we are free. Normally, we are lost in our thoughts, emotions, and feelings. When I was young, I was lost in my panic attacks.\nSo, meditation is to connect with our fundamental nature, which is already free and is already there within us, waiting to be discovered.\nNormally, I give a lot of examples. For example, if you have a watch, but you do not know that you have a watch, then the watch cannot tell you the time, right? If you recognize your watch, then the watch can tell you the time. The problem is not with the watch, the problem is whether you recognize the watch or not. If you do not recognize it, the watch cannot tell you the time, right? If you recognize it, then the watch can tell you the time.\nOur true nature is like a watch—it is wonderful! We have all these great qualities within us, but we need to recognize them. The first purpose is to recognize these amazing qualities within yourself. The second purpose is to transform everything into support for the recognition of your true nature, as support for awareness, compassion, wisdom, and happiness.\nEverything can be transformed into awareness, compassion, and wisdom. You can be happy anywhere with anything, right? There is nothing that you cannot transform, nothing that cannot become a support for your awareness, compassion, and wisdom.\nThere are two purposes. The first one is to connect with your true nature. The second purpose is to transform everything into support for your awareness, compassion, and wisdom so that you can be happy anywhere and anytime.\nMany of you have already learned how to transform form, sound, smell, taste, sensations—the five senses. We can use these five senses as a support for meditation.\nWhat is meditation? The essence of meditation is awareness. And we recognize that awareness is part of our fundamental nature, and we try to recognize awareness through form, sound, smell, taste, and sensation—through the five senses. We only have five senses. All of the five sensory objects can be used as supports for awareness.\nNow, the important thing is that we are going to recognize awareness without relying on an object. This is what we call, \"open awareness meditation,\" or sometimes we call it, \"meditation without an object, non-conceptual meditation,\" or \"being as it is.\" There are many names for this kind of meditation practice. It is a very special meditation practice.\nNormally, what we call \"awareness\" is the natural quality of our mind. Awareness is like a lamp. When I was young, I stayed on a mountain, and at that time we did not have electricity. In the evening, everything became dark, and then we used a lamp, a very nice quality lamp. My father would light the lamp, and then the house would be illuminated by the lamp.\nOne day, my father said:\n\"Our awareness or mind is like a lamp.\"\nA lamp has two qualities or what we call, \"two types of luminosity.\" When you light the lamp, you can see things in the house that are around the lamp—that is what we call, \"illuminating other,\" it illuminates other things than the lamp itself, like tables, shrines, the people in the room, like me and my father. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So we can see everything around it. But at the same time, my father said:\n\"The lamp is light.\"\nIn order to see the lamp itself you do not need to use a flashlight, right? The lamp&nbsp;is&nbsp;light. The nature of the lamp&nbsp;is&nbsp;light.\"\nOur mind is awareness. Right now, your mind is luminosity, or sometimes what we call, \"clarity, awareness,\" or \"consciousness\"—not the \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada\" consciousness, but rather, the basic level of consciousness. That is with you all the time.\nHow do we connect with that? You already know how to connect with the \"lamp\" that illuminates other objects, right? In order to connect with the lamp itself—if you want to connect with the lamp directly, in the beginning, it is quite difficult. We need to use different objects first. The lamp, which is an example for your mind, is illuminating through your eyes on to the object, thus, you can see the object. Through your ears, you can hear. Through your nose, you can smell. Through your tongue, you can taste. Through your body, you can sense the sensations.\nBut I have not taught you how to recognize awareness itself without an object. Why did not I teach you this first? Because normally, this is quite difficult.\nFor example, right now, in this room, we have light, right? Maybe you have light between you and this video. Can you see the light in this empty space? You can say that you can see it, but it is not so easy. Normally, when you try to see light, you always look for it on the wall, on the ground, on the floor, or on an object, right? To see light in an empty space is quite difficult. Therefore, our meditation, right now, is how to see light in the empty space.\nAnother way to put it is, \"How to be with the lamp itself.\" or \"How to connect with the lamp itself.\" There is no need to see the objects around it. But until now, in order to connect with the lamp, we have used the things around us.\nHow to do this practice? There are two steps because sometimes this is not so easy. So, therefore, we have two steps. The first step is to just be, to let be. Do not meditate, and even though you knew how to meditate before, let go of your meditation. You know how to do that, right? Normally, we all know how to practice non-meditation—just be.\nBefore you learned meditation, you did not know how to meditate, right? So, just like that. Just be. How to be? You know how to do that also, because in your everyday life, sometimes you are tired. Let us say you did physical exercise for half an hour, for example, jogging. You go to the park and you want to do exercise for half an hour, you are jogging and jogging. Or maybe you go to the mountain. Maybe I would jog on a mountain—we can jog together on a mountain. After finishing the jog, what do we do? We rest, like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche take a deep breath in and then exhales completely.] Do like that—just rest.\nAnother example is maybe when you are cooking. After you finish cooking, you rest also. Or any other examples, whatever you do in your normal life. How do you rest? Maybe you can tell me. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Normally, when I ask people, they say \"maybe after an exam,\" after a shower, after putting the kids to sleep, after a big event,\" or \"after 5 pm, especially on Fridays\"—5 or 7 pm, according to your own country. When you finish your work, you are so happy when you leave the office, and go back to your home. Rest like that. This is nothing new, you have been doing this every day. Especially, when you are stressed. Normally, when you feel stressed, what you do is to take a big breath in. [Mingyur Rinpoche takes a deep breath in and exhales completely through the mouth.] This depends on the customs of your country. In the Himalayas, we do like this… [Mingyur Rinpoche imitates Himalayan people.] In some countries, they do like this… [Mingyur Rinpoche does a different gesture.] And in some countries... [Mingyur Rinpoche does a different gesture and then laughs.] There are different styles. Whatever style we use is okay.\nNow, I will ask you to do one exercise with deep breathing, like this. Maybe you can watch me: slowly breathe in [Mingyur Rinpoche inhales slowly, holds the breath for a few seconds, and then let go with the exhale and rest.] Breath in deeply, not like this… [Mingyur Rinpoche exhales strongly and quickly.] If you do it like that, maybe you will get dizzy, and see stars and galaxies. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So you have to breathe in slowly, and then let go by exhaling deeply through your mouth. When you let go, rest in-between the in and out-breaths. Do not breathe in right away. Then return to natural breathing, and continue resting.\nLet us try this together. Please keep your meditation posture, and if you want to close your eyes, you can close your eyes. Relax your body. Now, please breathe in by breathing deeply. Now let go. Rest.\nNow, breathe naturally and continue resting.\nNow, take a deep breath in, again. Let go. Be.\nBreathe naturally, and continue to just be, continue resting. Do not meditate.\nNow, the last one. Slowly, slowly take a deep breath. [Mingyur Rinpoche breathes in slowly and then exhales and then rest.]\nContinue to breathe naturally.\nOkay. We have finished now. This is the first step.\nDo you know what the second step is? The second step is open awareness meditation, the really important meditation practice. The second one. Do you want to know? This is a big jump, you know? Until now, we have meditated only with objects. Now, let go of objects and be with awareness itself. It is quite difficult, right? But I can teach you if you are ready. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nNow I will teach you the second step—open awareness. Listen carefully. But first, I would like to tell you a big secret. It is a really important secret. Do you want to know the secret? Promise that you will not tell anyone. If you promise, then I will tell you. Raise your hand if you promise. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I am just kidding. It is in my books. Do not worry about promising not to tell anyone. I am just kidding.\nI will tell you the big secret. What is this open awareness meditation? Actually, the open awareness meditation is already finished. Did you get it? It means that we already practiced open awareness meditation. You did it!\nActually, there is no second step. The first step, what we did now, was relaxing. That is open awareness meditation. We normally say, \"Non-meditation is the best meditation.\" I asked you to not meditate and just be. That is all! So you have already learned it. I did not tell you, \"this is open awareness,\" because when we say \"open awareness is a very important meditation\" then our mind becomes tight. \"Am I doing this right or wrong? Is this it? It looks completely normal to me. I am just resting, how come this is open awareness meditation?\"\nBut actually, that is the one. You are just normal. Just be. You are not lost at that time, but you are not meditating, either. You are not meditating with any object, just being, just resting. And the mind is like a lamp—clear and knowing. The natural quality of the mind is just like the lamp—it is clear and knowing. Within that, thoughts can come and go, emotions can come and go, you do not care. You are not unconscious, right? As long as you are not totally unconscious, you are totally okay. It is just like that. It is very easy!\nNow, the important thing is to try to practice this with formal meditation and also in informal meditation. Apply this meditation in your life for short times, many times, especially when you are walking, talking, eating, etc. You can apply it anytime, everywhere, with anything. And, of course, during formal meditation, also.\nThank you! 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n105 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 4 days of practice\nTip\nWhether you are doing formal practice or informal practice, the method is the same: short moments of awareness, repeated many times.\nMeditating with Awareness and the Breath\nBegin session As you begin, check in with your posture, keeping your spine straight and letting your body be relaxed and at ease.\nBring your body and mind together, with a light awareness of the sensations in the body. Main practice While letting your breath be natural, become aware of the sensation of breathing—simply knowing when you are breathing in and when you are breathing out.\nNext, as you breathe out, notice the gap at the end of your exhalation and before the next inhalation begins. Simply rest naturally in this gap between each in- and out-breath.\nWhen you get lost in thoughts or emotions, just recognize this and bring your awareness to your breathing once again. End session Let go of the focus on the gap, and simply rest your mind in open awareness for a few moments before getting on with your day.\nRemember that this practice is something that you can do anywhere, anytime during the day. What effect does this practice have on you? What do you notice about the short periods when you rest in the gap between breaths?If you have tried other types of breathing meditations, how is the experience of this practice different compared with, for example, having a continuous awareness of the breath, or counting the breaths?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.7 Short Times Many Times Application\" data-href=\"1.1.7 Short Times Many Times Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.7-short-times-many-times-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.7 Meditation","our true nature is like a watch","awareness is like a lamp","lamp analogy"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/luminosity"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with the Out-Breath (40 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_the_Out-Breath_(40_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Open Awareness with the Out-Breath</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Open_Awareness_with_the_Out-Breath*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.7-short-times-many-times-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.7-short-times-many-times-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473581,"modifiedTime":1759272585300,"sourceSize":14706,"sourcePath":"1.

Because, in the beginning, the duration of your meditation is not very long. It is very short. So leave it short, but repeat it again and again and again. \"Many times\" really helps you to develop your meditation. It will improve your meditation. And \"short times\" is helpful for not giving in too much to the dullness or agitation—all these experiences. It is just short, so there is not too much time for dullness or having many thoughts. This is why short times, many times is really important.\nI will give you an example of the meaning of short times, many times. [Mingyur Rinpoche picks up a small brass gong and a wooden mallet.] There is a gong here. Short times, many times, in the beginning, is like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps the side of the gong lightly once, producing a faint sound.] Very short, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche taps lightly once more, producing a faint sound.] And the quality is not very good. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps it again.] The sound is not so nice. [Mingyur Rinpoche now taps the edge of the gong with care.] Now it is better. The sound has become clearer. And the duration has become… [Mingyur Rinpoche taps again.]… longer. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps with care once more, producing a bright sound.] Now it is better. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps with care once more, producing a yet brighter sound.] Now it is even better. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps again.] The duration is longer. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps again.] The quality is nice. The duration becomes longer.\nIn the same way, eventually your meditation quality becomes better and better and the duration becomes longer and longer.\nIf you do not know how to do short times, many times, I will give you an example of what will happen. Many people when they meditate want to meditate for a very long time. Then it becomes like this. [Mingyur bangs the gong, rattles the mallet on its rim and takes on a tense voice with tight breathing.] \"Relax! Relax! Concentrate!\" Then, after some time, you feel drowsy and then a lot of thoughts come. So the meditation experience will not feel nice.&nbsp;\nSome people misunderstand short times, many times and they practice like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche taps the gong and then immediately presses the mallet against the edge to muffle the sound that he had just created, then takes on a student's voice.] \"The teacher told me short times, many times, so I meditate and stop. Relax and stop.\" Do not do that. [Mingyur Rinpoche repeats the tap and immediate muffling.] It is not needed.\nThe main meaning of short times, many times is to just be natural. Just rest, and then you forget. That is okay. Repeat again. Forget. And do not worry about the quality. If your meditation feels fresh, nice, good experience is okay. Being dull, unclear, mixed with a lot of thoughts, that is also okay. Just try your best and do not care about the result.

In real meditation, you do not have to meditate. Just let your mind rest as it is. Whatever the state of your mind is, peaceful, not peaceful, thoughts or no thoughts, it does not matter. The background of all this is awareness, right? So just be with awareness, allowing it. Whatever thoughts or emotions arise, accept or allow them and just be. As long as you do not become unconscious, (Mingyur Rinpoche makes a face,) or completely lost, it is okay.\nSo, we will do this practice. This is also what we call, \"open presence meditation.\" Sometimes we call it, \"meditation without an object.\" There are a few different names. Some traditional texts call it, \"meditation without support.\"\nPlease keep your meditation posture. First, we will practice with a gentle out-breath. Breathe in and breathe out and pause a little bit. Then breathe in, breathe out, relax, and pause a little until you feel uncomfortable. Breathe in naturally. Do not force it. Breathe slowly. We will do this together. Keep your meditation posture. Now breathe in, breathing out naturally, and then pause.\n(Silence while meditating.)\nOkay, how was that? Now, we will try it without pausing the breath, just completely natural. You do not have to do anything with the breath. Let the mind just rest. Just be with a sense of presence.\n(Silence while meditating.)\nWhen you rest like that, you are not lost. There is awareness, but the awareness does not have a particular object. You are just relaxing. Some people might find some sense of presence, of being. Something is there. You cannot really describe it, but you are not lost. You are not meditating, but also not lost. Okay? That is all. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n105 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 4 days of practice\nInquiry\nHow is open awareness different from simply relaxing?\nTip\nWhatever meditation you are doing, always alternate with resting in open awareness.\nMeditating with Open Awareness\nBegin session Find a comfortable posture and notice any sensations that are present right now.&nbsp; Main practice You can choose to keep your eyes open or closed for this practice.\nLet go of the doing energy of the mind, and give yourself permission to simply be. There is nothing you need to focus or concentrate on. Allow thoughts and sensations to move freely through the body and mind. Simply be aware and present, having a sense of effortlessness.&nbsp;\nNext, bring a gentle awareness to your breath. Notice the feeling of the breath as it moves in and out of your body. Notice the warm sensation as you breath out, and the cool sensation as you breathe in.&nbsp;\nNotice that each time you exhale, there is a natural sense of relaxation and release. Let your awareness be relaxed and effortless as you open and release with each out-breath.\nNext, relax in the short gap between the out-breath and in-breath. Notice the quality of open, spacious awareness as you do so.&nbsp;\nNow, even let go of the out-breath, and just continue to rest in open awareness. There is nothing to do when you rest in open awareness. Simply be aware and present, connecting with the knowing quality of mind, and rest there.\nThere is no wrong experience in meditation. Awareness can accommodate everything and anything. Just let everything come and go naturally as you rest in open, spacious awareness.&nbsp;\nIf you find it helpful, you can return to the breath every now and then, alternating between resting in open awareness and resting in the gap between breaths. End session Just be for a few moments before getting on with your day. What did you experience when resting in open awareness, compared with using an object as support for awareness?How was the experience of simply being, letting thoughts and sensations come and go as they like?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.1.8 From Doing to Being Application\" data-href=\"1.1.8 From Doing to Being Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.8-from-doing-to-being-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.1.8 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Open Awareness (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Open_Awareness_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Open Awareness</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Open_Awareness*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.8-from-doing-to-being-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.1/1.1.8-from-doing-to-being-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473541,"modifiedTime":1759272585340,"sourceSize":5030,"sourcePath":"1.

Many people have a misunderstanding about meditation. Some people think meditation means they should think of nothing, emptying their minds, emptying their brains, and concentrate! Sometimes they do like this, they meditate and everything becomes tight. (Mingyur Rinpoche sits in a tight meditation posture.) They think, \"Practice! I am going to be aware of the breath!\" (Mingyur Rinpoche stresses the action of focusing tightly on his breath while keeping the meditation posture.) \"No thoughts!\" (Mingyur Rinpoche exhales forcefully.) This is too tight and not natural.&nbsp;\nAnother misunderstanding is what we call \"blissing out.\" You are looking for a particular state of mind like being peaceful, calm, and joyful. Some people meditate like this, they put an artificial smile on their face and do like this: (Mingyur Rinpoche assumes the meditation posture again with an exaggerated smile.) \"Peace! Relax! RELAX!\"\nWhen you try to be relaxed, you are actually tight. That is also not natural. When you look for peace, relaxation, or a joyful experience, normally what \"they\" say is \"I am busy, you have to make an appointment.\" Eventually, you see that you will not get peace, right? You become tighter.\nOne time I was in London, so I went to the palace. There was this guard who was very tight. The first time I saw this I was fascinated, so I went nearby and said hello. The guard did like this (Mingyur Rinpoche mimics a serious look with a smile twitching on his face.) I did not know why, but he was not looking at me and was not talking to me. Later I asked my friend, who said \"They are not supposed to laugh or talk. They have to be very firm.\" I thought this is like the example of being too tight in meditation. (Mingyur Rinpoche exaggerates a tight meditation pose.) \"Huh! Concentration!\"\nFor our meditation, we do not have to do this. Just be completely natural and normal. These are really important points for meditation. Many people misunderstand and think meditation is like looking for a particular state of mind. Now you do not have to do that. Just be completely natural.\nI will teach you a special meditation. The name of this special meditation is what I call \"pizza meditation.\" We will try it together.\nPlease keep your meditation posture. Keep your spine loosely straight. Now close your eyes. For pizza meditation, there is one rule. You are not allowed to think of pizza. You can think of anything else but not pizza. (Mingyur Rinpoche is meditating with eyes closed.)\nIf you think of pizza for one second, you will lose this meditation. So no pizza!\n(Mingyur Rinpoche opens his eyes to end the meditation) How was it? It is finished now. Was it easy or not easy? Of course, it was not easy, right? When you say \"no pizza,\" then what you think of is pizza! All the pizzas pop up in your mind. Even saying \"no pizza, no pizza\" is thinking about pizza.\nTherefore, many people have this misunderstanding that meditation means having no thoughts, no emotions, and to absolutely empty the mind. It does not work. Then more thoughts come, more emotions come. Or if you look for a particular state of mind, like peace, clarity, or joy. It is not easy to have those experiences. And actually, we do not need them. The essence of meditation is awareness. You are just aware and then the state of your mind is completely natural. You do not have to look for peace, calm, joy, or clarity. All these are the experiences of meditation. Peace, joy, clarity, and non-conceptual state are experiences of meditation, not the essence of meditation.\nWhen I was young, my father gave me another example. Say you want to have a picnic in a nice garden, and you prepare for that one day before. You bring a lot of food. You want to spend the whole day in that garden. As soon as you arrive in the garden, four policemen come and they say, \"We have a particular order for you. From now on, for the whole day, you cannot go out of this garden. You have to stay here.\" The four policemen are all watching you from the four directions, not smiling.\nWhat are you going to feel now? Now, you do not want to stay there even for one minute. Even if you eat your favorite food, there is no taste. What you think is that you really want to get out of the garden. But if there are no policemen, then you want to stay there for the whole day and enjoy it, right?\nTherefore, this is a really important point of meditation. We have to know how to be. To let your mind be in its natural state is really important.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nWhy are the experiences of meditation not important? How would you explain this to a friend who insists that a session of meditation that feels pleasant is better than a session that does not?\nPoints to remember:\nThe best way of meditating is to be completely natural.\nCommon misunderstandings about meditation are that you have to be very tight or very loose.\nThe experiences of meditation are things like peace, joy, clarity, non-conceptual, etc.\nThe experiences of meditation change, but the essence remains\nFor meditation, it is important to simply let the mind be in its natural state.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout objectless meditation.\nthe qualities of awareness.\nhow to rest the mind in awareness itself.\nthe benefits of resting the mind in awareness itself.

Choose one of those and decide that you will do your best to remember to apply your practice when this situation occurs. Instead of becoming irritated, use the object of distraction as the support for awareness.\nYou can alternate the above practice with resting your awareness on visual objects during the day. You do not have to stay with an object for long, just a few moments.

Saljay Rinpoche has been a great teacher in my life. I still had a rejection or a sense of \"I do not like my panic.\" This was followed by a feeling and a lot of symptoms in the body like a burning sensation, a knot in the stomach, headache, I could not breathe, etc., so I had a lot of difficulties with that, and my mind was normally a little bit sensitive. My teacher Saljay Rinpoche said:\n\"Do not fight the emotions, make friends with them.\"\nHe told me this story:\nIn Tibet, there was a businessman and at this time, there was business all the way along the border between China and Tibet. They had a lot of animals. Of course, during this time, there were no cars, no buses, no flights, nothing; everything was packed on the back of animals. In some places where there were a lot of robberies, the robbers stayed inside mountains, hiding, and this businessman needed to hire a strong bodyguard. Even though the bodyguards were very strong, they needed to fight with the robbers. Sometimes the bodyguards won, sometimes the robbers won, and there was a loss of all the merchandise from time to time. They always had some problems. Then, one day the businessman thought, \"Okay, maybe I should hire the robbers as my bodyguards.\" Then he talked to the head of the robbers and made an agreement that they work for him and he would give them a salary. Then the robbers were very happy, and from that day, these robbers became the bodyguards of that businessman. Later his business became very good; there was no robbery on the way and the robbers got a job. They all were very happy.&nbsp;\nMy Teacher told me that the best antidote, the best protection, is the best guide — here it is the robber. So for meditation, the best antidote is the obstacle, the problem, whatever you are facing. If that becomes support for your practice, if that becomes support for your meditation, eventually everything becomes support for meditation. You can meditate everywhere, anytime, under any circumstance.\nSo, how do you do that? Normally, we feel that things are distracting for us, but now we can use them as support for our meditation; like form, sound, smell, taste, sensation, thoughts, and emotions. Some of you have already learned this, some of you have not yet learned, but eventually, everything becomes support for meditation. What we experience — we have these five senses, plus thoughts and emotions — if you can make friends with these and transform all of them into support for your meditation, then everything can become support for your meditation.\nOtherwise, many people when they meditate do not like to hear noises, they want peace, and as soon as they hear some noise they get very angry. Then they try to close the window or sometimes try to shout at the person making noise. This creates a lot of problems, and make enemies of all your neighbors. So after you learn meditation, a few weeks later, all your neighbors become your enemies (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.) This is not a good idea, right? Therefore, it is really important to turn everything into your friend. 15 minutes of formal meditation each day\n105 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 4 days of practice (Streak = consecutive days of practice)\nUse the practice instructions given by Mingyur Rinpoche and in the guided meditations\nYou can also find a meditation guide in the Welcome to the Course/Course Material\nInquiry\nWhen a source of distraction occurs, how can you make it your friend?\nMeditating with Visual Objects\nBegin session Begin by finding a comfortable posture, keeping your spine upright and letting your mind and body be relaxed and at ease.\nClose your eyes if that is more comfortable, and then simply rest in open awareness for a few moments. Main practice If you had your eyes closed, gently open them, and rest your gaze on an object in front of you.&nbsp;\nYou do not need to analyze the object. Simply notice the color and shape of the object, and then just rest in the knowing of seeing.&nbsp;\nYou do not need to block thoughts. Let them come and go as you continue to rest your awareness on the object in front of you.\nTake a break from focusing on the visual object and rest in open awareness for a few moments.\nWhen you feel ready, once again rest your awareness on an object in front of you.\nIf the object seems to move, that is okay. Simply know that the object appears to be moving. End Session Let go of the visual object and rest in open awareness for a few moments before continuing on with your day. Do you experience any difference between looking at an object with awareness versus looking at it without awareness?Is it more difficult to use an object that is moving, rather than still?

Anything can be used as support for meditation, and using a visual object is one meditation technique. Do you know how to practice meditation with a visual object – Yes or no? Yes, raise your hand. No, raise your hand. Maybe some of you say \"No,\" right? Actually, you know, but you do not know that you know. Now, do you know? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Meditation is all about awareness. Although there are many different meditation techniques, they are all one – just awareness. So, just be aware of visual objects. That is all! Can you see my hand? If you can see my hand, that is all. Can you see me? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] If you can see me now, that is all. When the eyes and mind are looking at an object together, that is visual object meditation.\nFor example, here is an apple. When you meditate on the apple, the eyes and mind both look at the apple. That's it! Sometimes what we do is with our eyes we are looking at the apple, but our mind is looking at a pizza – thinking about pizza. The eyes and mind go in different directions. But now, our eyes and mind are both looking at the apple. Be with the apple. Then after some time, you forget. That is okay. Come back to the apple. Lost. Come back. Remember: you are giving a part-time job to the monkey mind. We need to give the monkey mind a job, and this job is, \"Hello. Watch the apple.\" Then you forget again. So, you repeat this again and again.\nYou can choose any object in front of you, and we are going to practice this together.\nFirst, please keep your meditation posture. Close your eyes, and rest your mind as it is. Relax your body and your mind.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please open your eyes. Do not control your eyes blinking. You can blink. Look at whatever things are there in front of you. Just look at the objects with your eyes and mind together.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow close your eyes, and rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nHow was it? When you look at an object, there are four uncomfortable feelings. (1) The object becomes two – two apples. Your eyes become crossed also. (2) The object is moving, and you feel like you are moving and may become a little bit dizzy, sometimes. (3) Some kind of color comes. Bright or dark colors, so you cannot see the object. (4) Your eyes hurt, so it feels like you have to blink a lot. All of these are normal. There is nothing wrong. It is okay. If you see two objects, you can watch two objects. But if you blink, it becomes one again. That is completely okay.\nNow, I would like to mention the three personalities. These are what we call the \"body, speech, and mind personalities. These three personalities are really important to know because the meditation experience might be different. For example, the body personality is normally involved with forms, shapes, and colors. The body has a form, shape, and color, right? Therefore, this is what we call the \"body personality.\" The speech personality is involved with labeling – the voice. The mind personality has a sort of feeling, sensation, and intuition. When someone with the body personality looks at the apple, you will be involved with the shape and color of the apple. When someone with the speech personality looks at the apple, you need to say \"apple.\" \"Apple. Apple. Apple.\" So, you have to say or label it. Someone with the mind personality \"feels\" the apple, is \"being\" with the apple. It is almost like being with the apple without thinking.\nThese three personalities have different meditation experiences. Sometimes, when you and your friend discuss meditation experience, it can be completely different. Your friend says, \"Oh, I am just being with the apple.\" And you say, \"I have to say apple. How come?\" But it is okay. Whatever your personality is, be with that.\nSo, this is quite important to know. And this is not only true for meditation, but also in everyday life. For example, if you go to a nice place for a holiday, then, when you come back and think about it, if an image comes first, you are the body personality. If the labeling – the voice – comes first, you are the speech personality. If the feeling or sensation comes first, you are the mind personality. But sometimes, there are two personalities together – a mixed personality – that is also possible. Depending on this, your way of thinking, learning, and experiencing things is different. This is okay. Just accept the personality you are, and be with that.\nThis is visual object meditation and the three different personalities. These are ways of understanding the different experiences of meditation.\nNow it is finished!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow is meditating on a visual object different from simply looking at the object?

Then they cease to be distractions and become supports for your meditation practice.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow we are going to practice with smell.\nUntil now, we have already made friends with many things. So, congratulations! You can even make friends with unpleasant sounds from time to time, right? This is a great achievement! Of course, you cannot do that all the time. That is okay.\nNow, we are going to use a new object, which is smell. Do you know how to meditate with smell? Yes or no? I think you know, but you do not know that you know. Now, do you know? I want to ask this every time, because we really need to go back to the one important thing, which is awareness, right? It is simple. Actually, you are learning only one meditation technique, which is awareness. So, what is changing? The different objects.\nSo now, we will meditate using smell. Do you smell anything now? I do not smell anything, but you might have some smell. Let us say, for example, you go to a restaurant and you smell something from outside. When you breathe in, be aware of the smell, and when you breathe out, just relax. Let it be. Breathe in, be aware of the smell, and let it be.\nNow, we are going to try this together. Some of you might smell something and some of you not, but just try with whatever smell you have, and we will practice this together. Please keep your meditation posture. First, rest your mind in open awareness. Open presence and open awareness have the same meaning. Just rest in awareness itself.\n(Silent meditation.)\nWhen you breathe in, try to be aware of any smell. When you breathe out, just let it be and relax. If you do not smell anything, then just be aware that there is no smell. It does not matter if there are pleasant smells or unpleasant smells.\n(Silent mediation.)\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness again.\n(Silent mediation.)\nOkay. How was it?\nNext time when you go to have lunch or dinner, if you smell something when you breathe in, smell and let go, relax. You can practice everywhere.\nYou do not have to look for a particularly pleasant smell. An unpleasant smell is also okay. But in the beginning, you cannot use an unpleasant smell as support for meditation. It takes time. Normally, if you can, use anything as support for your meditation. That is really important. Otherwise, you will only look for pleasant smells, right?\nSome people really do not like bad smells or noisy sounds. One time I met a person who said she really did not like to meditate with sound or busy things. She thought the city was a really terrible place for meditation. She wanted to meditate in the mountains. She was waiting for that opportunity, and one day she asked her boss for time off. Then she could finally take off and she went to the mountains. For the first few hours, she was so happy! \"Finally, I made it!\" She meditated in the mountains with a big smile. Then, after some time, she heard, \"Schou, schou, schou,\" a lot of birds came. She thought, \"Wow, these birds are noisy. Why will they not keep quiet?\" Then she heard another sound, which was the wind blowing in the trees, \"Shhhalalala.\" Then there were the creeks, the rivers, and the animals!\nIn the end, the mountains were full of noise, full of obstacles for meditation. It was worse than in the city. Then she thought, \"Okay, now I have a new plan.\" The new plan was to make a sound-proof room and lock the door and windows, prepare the best cushion, and make it a comfortable temperature. So, she did that in the end. She was meditating and was so happy in the beginning. \"Okay, finally I made it!\" After some time, she got itchy. She had a lot of salivae. \"What happened? I have a lot of salivae today. Oh, something is wrong with my cushion. I thought this was the best cushion, but it is a little bit uncomfortable. I need to change something. There are a lot of objects in front of me. Maybe I need to move all of this? Maybe I have to look at this or on this wall?\" So, the obstacles were still there. So, she could not find peace. There were obstacles everywhere.\nBut, if you can really meditate with whatever comes into your mind and in your perception, if you can use them as support for your meditation, then you can meditate in the mountains or in the city. If it is quiet or not so quiet, both are okay. You can meditate everywhere, anytime, under any circumstances, and with anything.\nBut, of course, it is not easy in the beginning. You have to do this by practicing step-by-step. 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n140 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice\nTip\nWhen there is a strong scent, let that be a reminder for resting in awareness.\nMeditating with Smell\nBegin session Take a moment to check in with your posture. Keep your spine upright and be relaxed and at ease.\nNotice any sensations present in your body. Whatever you feel, just notice it.\nTake a few deep breaths, and let your body and mind relax further as you exhale. Simply rest in open awareness for a while before moving on.\nBring a sense of meaning to your practice by setting an inspiring motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, to benefit not only myself, but also my friends, family, and society.\" Main practice As you rest in open awareness, bring your attention to any smells that are present. Use these smells as supports for awareness. Just rest your awareness lightly on the smell. If you smell nothing at all, simply notice that.\nNext, slowly get up, and begin to move around. As you move from room to room, notice if there are any smells.&nbsp;\nEvery time your mind wanders off, just notice that. This is completely normal. When you notice this has happened, bring your awareness back to whatever you smell in this moment.&nbsp;\nNext, if there are things around you, smell them and just notice whether the smells are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. However they are, simply be present with each of them.\nTake a break and just rest in open awareness for a few moments, not doing anything in particular, just being.\nOnce again, return to meditating on smell. Try to simply be present with whatever smell is there.\nIf you are moving around, move back to where you started, sit back down on the chair or cushion, and continue the practice in a seated position. End Session Let go of the smell meditation and just rest in open awareness. If you have been sitting with your eyes closed, you can gently open them.\nEnd your session with a dedication, thinking, \"May this meditation benefit others, including my friends, family, and society.\" Is there a difference using pleasant smells as a support for meditation compared to unpleasant ones?

For me, it has been really amazing. When I began to learn meditation, a lot of things that I never thought about became my friends. They became meaningful. Even the obstacles, even the problems may become opportunities to grow and help us to learn. It becomes like an adventure. It is really amazing! It is very important that we acknowledge this, that we appreciate and feel happy about this. I think this is really important.&nbsp;\nAlso, when we meditate, we have to think about this at the beginning of the meditation. It gives a sense of meaning. You meditating is actually really meaningful, not only for you but also for your friends, family, colleagues, and society. If everybody in the world wanted to transform inside, then the world would become peaceful. We have had a lot of wars in the past. People did not want to transform themselves but they wanted to change the world. This is a big problem. Normally, we would say that if the transformation comes from inside then there is a positive influence, and this influence is very strong, even if you do not say it. Scientists say that whatever we learn, only 7% is from words, and 93% of what we learn is nonverbal. It influences. It is contagious, like the flu.\nTherefore, next time you meditate, in the beginning, you should develop this motivation. Be aware that your meditation is meaningful. You can also think, \"I am going to meditate not only to benefit myself but also my friends, family, and society,\" even your cat, dog, puppy—whatever—even just one or two persons. It is really important to feel this and to acknowledge it. When you begin your meditation, bring that sense of meaning to your meditation. Then, after meditating, in the end, you dedicate, \"May this meditation benefit others, benefit my friends, family, and society.\" Whatever you want to dedicate to, you dedicate to others.\nBegin with great motivation, and end with dedication. Then whatever meditation practice you do, everything transforms. Even if you meditate on sound, that transforms, as compassion transforms into kindness, because of the motivation in the beginning. Even if while listening to sound, you do not feel particular compassionate or similar feelings, the continuation of the motivation is there. Even if this is not visible to you, it is there. Like alchemy, it is transforming everything into love and compassion. In this way, meditation also really benefits you, benefits others, and society.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow can meditation offer a sense of meaning even with difficult situations in life? Question 2\nWhy are motivation and dedication two important aspects of practice? Points to remember:\nMeditation can make everything in life feel meaningful.\nBegin your practice session with the motivation. Conclude with dedication.\nMeditation not only benefits you, but also others and society.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.2 Making Everything Meaningful Meditation\" data-href=\"1.2.2 Making Everything Meaningful Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.2-making-everything-meaningful-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Making Everything Meaningful (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Making_Everything_Meaningful_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Making Everything Meaningful</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Making_Everything_Meaningful*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.2-making-everything-meaningful-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.2-making-everything-meaningful-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474088,"modifiedTime":1759272585456,"sourceSize":3963,"sourcePath":"1.

If you think you can practice for four minutes, stop at three; if you think you can practice for five minutes, stop at four. Practicing in this way, you'll find yourself eager to begin again. Rather than thinking you've accomplished your goal, leave yourself wanting more.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nWe need to integrate meditation into everyday life. Today I will give you some examples of this.&nbsp;\nNow, you are watching this video, right? Do you know that you are watching this video? Yes, you do, right? So, now it has become meditation. Be aware that you are watching this video, right now. Continue to be aware that you are watching this video, and I will continue to talk. Be aware.\nThis is really important. Of course, when we sit on the cushion and all the circumstances are good and the environment is nice, then we have some experience of meditation. But when we go off the cushion and go into everyday life, then sometimes we forget – even though we know that we can meditate anywhere anytime.\nNow, I want to elaborate more on this. You can build this habit in everyday life. Whenever you open the refrigerator – [Mingyur Rinpoche snap his fingers] awareness, meditation. Refrigerator, meditation. Refrigerator, meditation. Whenever you go to the bathroom – bathroom, meditation. Bathroom, meditation. Or at your office. At your office, you can put some flowers, and whenever you see the flowers, remember meditation.\nYou need to do that for seven days or so. After that, you will get used to it; even if you see the flowers you will not remember, so then change to different flowers. Or maybe you can put up a special sticker – every week you have a new sticker. Maybe the area is the same, but there is a new sticker. So you feel that it is a little bit new, fresh, and exciting – it is a little bit creative. So do that.\nAre you aware now? Do not get lost, okay? Do not forget. Be aware that you are watching this video now, while you are listening. I know it is quite difficult, but you can do it! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nFirst, we need to build this habit with small things. We can associate an environment with meditation, or a situation with meditation, or a place with meditation. You can think of that.\nNow, I want to change your meditation. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Now, if you are seated, please stand up. Do it if it is possible, if it is allowed. If you are in a meeting or somewhere that standing up is not good, then do not do it. Otherwise, if you are sitting, stand up. If you are standing, sit down, if possible. Now, whether you are sitting or standing, just be aware. When you stand up, just be aware that you are standing up. When you are sitting, just be aware that you are sitting. That way you can build a habit with these two. When you stand up, you can build a habit with that. When you sit down, you can build a habit out of that.\nNow, I will continue to talk, and however you are sitting, be aware of that. Continue to be aware while you are listening. You have to multitask! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It is okay, no problem. Even if you are confused – as long as you know that you are confused, then you are okay.\nWhen I was young in the monastery, I built a particular habit when I was studying. We had this class schedule. It was a very busy schedule, and I liked to take breaks. During class, we had a ten or five-minute break from time to time, and then I liked to go to the restroom – in our rooms, we did not have attached bathrooms – so during the breaks, I was happy. And I began to meditate. When I came out of the classroom, there were small stairs. I went up the stairs, and then I had to go right and left to use the restroom. While I was using the restroom I tried to meditate. Then I came down, still trying to be aware. Sometimes, I liked to look at the mountains. So, I would look at the mountains and at the whole monastery, at what the people were doing, and then I would forget. But then, when I saw the stairs again, when I came down, \"Oh!\" I would remember again and then continue to study. While I studied, most of the time, I would forget, but it was really good that I built a habit like this. That really helped me. So, you can do something like that as well.\nHow is it? Are you still aware? Now, you can sit down or stand up. Whatever you like to do. You can do it in a normal way.\nIn this way, we need to build active meditation in everyday life. It has really been of benefit to me, and I hope it will be of benefit to you.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesPick a certain object or task that will become the reminder for awareness for the duration of going through this section.

To change this force of habit, you need to build up a new habit. And in order to build a new habit, we have to do it step by step. In the beginning, you cannot do too much. You just do a little bit. And we need time. At least 20 to 30 days. Let us say, if you want to meditate for maybe 30 minutes a day, first do not meditate 30 minutes—maybe just 15 minutes. If you want to meditate for one hour, maybe first just 30 minutes or 20 minutes. And try to think that timewise, it is only just for one month—do not think that it is forever. Try that every day. Even if you do not like it. Even if you feel really bored, \"Oh... I want to grab my phone!\" You get itchy, and your hands and muscles are looking for your phone. But the scheduled time is short—you can bear with it! After three weeks, it becomes much easier because your habit has changed. After one month, it is even easier. After three months, it becomes very solid. We need to build up habits like that.\nFor example, I went to the Himalayan mountains. There are people in the Himalayan mountains who do not take showers. Maybe they take a shower once a year. In the Himalayan mountains, it does not smell, too much. But sometimes, they come down to the lower parts of Nepal. Kathmandu is a big city, and it is quite warm. They come to see me, and then they smell. The smell spreads about ten meters around them. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] When they are outside my door, I can smell them from the inside. They come and I tell them, \"Okay, take a shower. The weather is hot and it will be good for you.\" They say, \"Okay, okay. Thank you!\" And the next day they may take a shower. But then, the next day after that, they do not want to shower again, even if I give them money, soap, and everything. They say, \"Okay,\" but they do not want to shower because they have such a strong feeling of resistance to trying again. Why? They do not have the habit.\nBut for us, each day we spend maybe 20 or 30 minutes altogether in the bathroom—in the mornings and evenings. Maybe we shower or bathe, brush our teeth, cut our hair, or do our makeup. We spend all this time in the bathroom, but for us, it is just like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.] Because we have the habit. It has become a daily routine.\nWe need to make whatever we do a part of our daily routine. Otherwise, even if you really like it, you feel it is good, but you cannot continue. For example, do you believe that doing exercise every day is good for you? If you believe that, raise your hand. I think you raise your hand, right? When you do exercise, you feel a little bit good, right? Most of the time. After exercise, you feel good. But can you exercise every day? Right now are you exercising every day? If yes, raise your hand. I think most people cannot raise their hand, because you cannot do it. You like it, you feel good, but you cannot continue. Why? Because of the force of habit.\nIt is really important that we consider this. We have to understand this. Sometimes we feel bad—we really like to meditate, and when we think of meditation or when we meditate it feels good, but we cannot continue. Then we feel like, \"Oh, maybe something is wrong with me. I am a failure,\" or something like that. That is normal. And if you cannot build the habit then it stays the same.\nIt is really important to build this habit of formal meditation every day. To fully dedicate a certain time for meditation, that is formal meditation. For informal meditation, you can meditate anywhere, anytime, under any circumstances. Just like short times, many times. While you are walking, talking, or eating, etc. You can \"tie\" this habit with using stickers, a counter, or writing a note that says \"awareness\" or \"meditation\" and whenever you see this note you are reminded of meditation. Or you can use a small \"beep\"—whenever you hear \"beep\" from your smartphone you will go, \"Oh! Meditation.\" Or whenever you open the door, \"meditation.\" Something like that. You need to build up a habit out of doing that. That will really be of benefit to you.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWhy is it more helpful to sit for shorter periods than you know you can?

How many of you like eating meditation? Raise your hand.\nI liked eating meditation when I was young. In the morning we had breakfast. When I was with my father, we always had lunch and dinner together. But, in my monastery, most of the time, I ate alone. It is quite nice to practice eating meditation because every day you have to eat at least two times. Nowadays, what do you call it? Brunch? Breakfast and lunch together. So two times, at least. Sometimes three times. Sometimes you drink coffee or tea. In Europe, in some places you have teatime. So, there are many times each day you get to experience taste.\nHow do you practice this? It is very simple. I think you know already. Should I ask you? Do you know how to practice taste meditation or eating meditation? Maybe you know, but you do not know that you know. Why? Because the essence of meditation is awareness. Awareness means \"knowing.\" So you just know the taste. Just be aware of the taste while you are eating.\nWe will practice this together now. You can pause my video and look for some food – maybe dried nuts, fruits, or whatever you like. Okay, I hope you got it. I also have dried nuts.\nNow, please sit down. Keep your meditation posture. And rest your mind as it is – just be.\n(Silent meditation.)\nNow, please take the dried nut or whatever food you have and put it in your mouth. And be aware of taste. I taste saltiness. This nut is salty. And you can chew now. While you are chewing, be aware of the taste, and move the food around in your mouth. Chew well, and move the food around in your mouth. Do not forget to be aware of the taste. But do not be too tight. Just eat naturally. Yum, this is tasty!\nNow, after you finish eating, rest your mind as it is – in open awareness.\nHow was it? Does it taste good or not so good? For many people, the taste becomes better, for some people, the taste becomes worse, and for some, it stays the same. It does not matter. It is normal. So the next time when you go out for lunch or dinner, try this practice. Eat mindfully. Eat with awareness.\nSo far, we have learned many different meditation techniques. As I mentioned, all of these meditation techniques are about making friends with everything, about transforming everything into support for awareness and meditation. Although it looks like there are many meditation techniques, there is actually only one. But, because of differences in personality, some meditation techniques feel better for some people. Although awareness is one, because of the object, you feel like you have more of a connection with sound meditation, or maybe more of a connection with visual objects, or more of a connection with taste and sensation.\nMaybe I should ask you: How many of you like sound meditation the best? Raise your hand. Or is meditating with visual objects the best? Raise your hand. Or is taste meditation the best? Or sensation? Or open awareness?\nFirst, we begin with the meditation technique that is suitable for us. We have to try that first. Then, after some time, you feel bored. Even though you like one meditation technique the best, a few hours or days later, you feel bored. Like if you eat your favorite food every day. Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. Breakfast. Lunch. Dinner. After some time, you feel like, \"Gosh, I hate it. I do not like having this food again.\" Right? It is the same thing with meditation. Even though you feel like you have a connection with one meditation technique, after a certain level, you need to change.\nFor me, when I was young, open awareness was the best. I really liked to just be. Then, some time later, I felt a little bit heavy. My body would become a little bit warm – heat came. I would feel a little disgusted. But I really liked open awareness, so I continued to practice, but I felt dull sometimes. Then I asked my father, and my father said, \"Change your meditation technique.\" Then I listened to sound. At first, it was very nice – it was fresh! But I still liked open awareness. Then my father said, \"Let it go.\" So I let go of open awareness and then listened to sound. Then it was fresh! So later, I came to know the benefit of changing meditation techniques. It is really important.\nThese different meditation techniques are really good for finding something suitable for your personality. And the second benefit is that it keeps your meditation fresh. You need to change from time to time.\nI think it will be of benefit to you! 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n140 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice\nTip\nEvery time you sit down to eat, let it be a reminder for recognizing awareness.\nMeditating with Taste\nBegin session&nbsp; Find something that you can use during this meditation, like candy, gum, or something else with a flavor.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to check in with your posture. Find a posture that is comfortable and supportive for meditation.\nNext, rest in open awareness for a minute or two. Drop the doing energy of the mind and simply be as you are in this moment. Just rest in effortless awareness.\nBring a sense of meaning to your practice by setting an inspiring motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, to benefit not only myself but also my friends, family, and society.\" Main practice Bring your attention to any taste you have right now. Even if there is nothing in your mouth, see whether there is any lingering taste and just notice it. If you do not notice any taste, that is fine too; just continue to rest in open awareness.\nWhen you feel ready, take the candy, gum, or food you have and place it in your mouth. Now, rest your awareness on this taste.&nbsp;\nNext, explore the subtlety of what you are tasting; notice the texture, flavors, and nuances.\nFrom time to time, let go of the taste meditation and just rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nReturn to the taste. Notice whether the taste is pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Explore what the experience of taste is actually like. End Session If your eyes have been closed, gently open them, and rest in open awareness.\nEnd your session with a dedication, thinking, \"May this meditation benefit others, including my friends, family, and society.\" Decide to practice eating meditation one time each day as you work through this section of the course. When you're having a meal alone, you can practice during the whole meal; if you eat with others, commit to practice eating meditation with the first and last bite, and you can engage in conversations in between. Remember to set an intention each morning to practice during the meals. If you wish, you can also set reminders on your phone just before your mealtimes.Do you notice any difference in practicing eating meditation during your formal meditation sessions compared to practicing during meals?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.4 Non-Meditation Application\" data-href=\"1.2.4 Non-Meditation Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.4-non-meditation-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Taste (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Taste_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Taste</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Taste*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Instructions","level":4,"id":"Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.4-non-meditation-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.4-non-meditation-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474044,"modifiedTime":1759272585525,"sourceSize":7921,"sourcePath":"1.

The main reason was that I had panic attacks. I hated my panic, and I really wanted to get rid of my panic. I needed my mind to be calm and peaceful, but the thoughts and emotions came, and I did not like that\nMy first idea of meditation was that I would empty my mind, and have no thoughts or emotions. I was looking for a particular state of mind, a special state of mind. Later, I asked my father, and my father gave me more and more meditation teachings. He said that meditation is not about blocking thoughts, not about controlling, not about creating something special, such as a special state of mind. It is all about awareness, recognizing awareness, and being with that. Everything is allowed. Awareness is really free, present, and open. Awareness is calm and peaceful. It took me a while to experience, it was not so easy.\nToday, I would like to do something experiential. I am teaching that, so now I will teach you a very special meditation. It is what we call, \"pizza meditation.\" For pizza meditation, what we have to do is simple. There is one rule: you are not allowed to think about pizza. No pizza! You can think about anything else – your work, your past history, your future plans, anything is okay, but not pizza, okay?\nLet us practice together. Please keep your meditation posture, close your eyes, and relax the muscles in your body. If you cannot relax, it is also okay – allow that you cannot relax. Okay, now, no pizza! You cannot think of pizza, even for one second. If you think of pizza for one second, you have lost this meditation.\n(Silent meditation.)\nOkay. We are finished. How was it?\nWas it easy, or not so easy? If you feel it was not easy, raise your hand. I think it is not easy. Why is it not easy? Because when you say, \"No pizza!\" then you think about pizza. All the pizza thoughts pop up in your mind: big pizzas, small pizzas, medium pizzas. Even if you say, \"No pizza,\" you are thinking about pizza. You say, \"No pizza. No pizza\" and the picture of pizza becomes clearer.\nTherefore, for meditation, we do not need to block any thoughts or emotions. It is not necessary. For example, when you listen to sounds, as long as you can hear the sounds, if a thought of pizza comes, there is no problem. Let pizza come and go. Or, when you go through your to-do list. Many people have a lot of lists. Or if you worry about deadlines, exams, or anything. Do not try to block thoughts. If you try to block them, you cannot. Instead, there will be more. They will be louder and noisier. So what can you do? Go back to the sounds, and stay with the sounds. As long as you do not forget the sounds, whatever thoughts arise, they can come and go\nI will tell you another example. If you want to go for a picnic in a nice garden, and you prepare a very nice pizza – maybe you brought the very best pizza, a delicious pizza. And as soon as you arrive in the garden, four policemen come from the four directions and look at you. Then they say, \"We have a particular order for you. You have to stay in this garden for the whole day. You are not allowed to go out of the garden.\" Now, how will you feel? You will feel like you do not want to stay there, you will want to go out. You will think, \"Why? Who gave me this order? Why?\" Before, you wanted to stay the whole day, and if there were no police you would stay there the whole day eating pizza. But now, even if you eat pizza, there is no taste. It is like that.\nSo this is a big misunderstanding. People think that meditation is thinking of nothing, no thoughts, no emotions, empty mind, empty brain. or some people strongly focus on the breath.\nI received this meditation instruction when I was young, my father gave me those instructions. Later, when I went to different places, based on different cultures, the meditation style also differs. Some cultures are more like, \"No thoughts. No emotions. Concentrate on the sound!\" It is like that.\nIn other places, they are looking for a special state of mind. They put a fake smile upon their faces, and then say, \"Peace…Relax…Relax.\" So when you say, \"Relax,\" then you are tight.\nBut, in real meditation, actually, you do not have to meditate. We call this, \"Non-meditation is the best meditation.\" It means meditation is completely natural. When you listen to a sound, just be natural. That is all, right? Similarly, when you are aware of a physical sensation, be completely natural. You do not have to do anything. There is no need to block thoughts or emotions. You do not have to create a special state of mind. If you try to look for a peaceful, calm, non-conceptual state of mind, it will say, \"I am busy.\" If you look for peace, peace will say, \"I am busy.\" So, do not care. Just be completely natural. This is what I sometimes call, \"organic meditation.\"\nFor this meditation, be completely natural, organic, and you do not have to meditate. There is nothing you need to stop or block, and there is nothing you need to create.\nBe with awareness. Awareness is free, present, pure, and genuine. Awareness is calm. And awareness is with you all the time.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow would you explain to a friend that in real meditation, you actually don't have to meditate?

That's because we're used to our chains. They might chafe, they might make us bleed, but at least they're familiar.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nYou already learned awareness of the body, so at this time, especially when you are facing strong emotions, watch the sensation.&nbsp;\nNow, we are going to practice this together. If you are feeling strong emotions now, wonderful! How many of you have some kind of a strong emotion now? Raise your hand. Great. If you do not have a strong emotion, that is a big problem! [Mingyur Rinpoche is laughing.] No, it is not a problem. It is Okay. If you do not have a strong emotion now, you can remember any strong emotion from the past. Try to remember a strong emotion. I hope when you remember this situation, then you have some sensation in the body. You have to watch that sensation.\nOkay. Let us try it together.\nFirst, keep your spine loosely straight. Close your eyes. First, we will do the general scan of the body from head to feet.\nNow, particularly look for unpleasant sensations in your body. If you do not have any now, then bring to mind one negative emotion, a strong emotion: hatred, anxiety, a sad feeling, whatever, stress.\nNow, please watch this sensation in your body from your stomach. It sometimes feels like a crunch or like it is burning. From the stomach, it goes to the heart. From the heart, it goes to the head, and then to the whole body. This sensation is changing like a wave on the ocean, curving, changing, going up and down.\nAllow it. Do not control this sensation. Allow it to be in awareness.\nOkay. How was it?\nIf you feel the sensation is too strong and overwhelming, if you cannot watch it, then stop, open your eyes, and just relax. Sometimes when you watch the sensation, the sensation disappears. You cannot find it. That is great! There is some kind of gap. Then just rest in the gap. If the sensation does not disappear or grow stronger, then continue to watch the sensation. The sensation changes. It becomes like the waves of the ocean. The location also changes. From the stomach, it goes to the head, it goes to the back. Just allow it.\nThis has really helped me. Normally, I would feel like I was the panic. My panic and I became one. But when I watched it like this, then I feel like there is some space. I am watching, so the panic is part of me, not me. That really, really helped me. Also, the panic became the object of my meditation. I let panic be in the awareness. I felt that awareness was bigger than panic. The panic comes and goes, and the awareness is holding it, like space. This has been really beneficial for me.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesThink of a situation, person, or something else that brings up unpleasant sensations in your daily life. Each day, tell yourself that you will turn this event into an opportunity to practice. Remind yourself in the morning that this person or event will be the reminder for practice. Take a few moments at the end of each day to reflect on how it went and decide how to apply the practice of self-antidote the next day.Journal Reflection Question 1In what situations do you see yourself using the self-antidote practice? What are you planning to do?Journal Reflection Question 2Are there situations or things in which it feels like too much to use the thing itself as a support for awareness?

They are our friends.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, we are going to practice pain meditation. This is not so easy, but I hope that at least you can learn how to practice it – even though you may not feel like this is your favorite meditation practice. But, actually, for meditation, we can use anything – whatever is happening in our lives – as supports for our meditation, right?&nbsp;\nWhen we practice awareness of the body, that is more like sensations in general. But today, we are looking for a particularly unpleasant sensation – pain. So, for pain meditation, you need pain. If you do not have pain, then you are not eligible to practice this pain meditation. I am sorry to tell you that.\nIf you have pain now, you are lucky! Because we can practice pain meditation together. If you do not have pain, then give yourself a slap! No no, just kidding. Do not do that. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But, if you do not have pain, I have an idea of how to create pain. How to do that? Press here. [Mingyur Rinpoche put pressure on the area between the thumb and index finger.] On the \"web\" – around here. When you press here, you will have pain but it is good for your body. It is an acupuncture point that is good for the sinuses, stomach, it has a lot of benefits. So we will use this as support for our meditation, ok?\nBut if you have a baby in your stomach then do not do that. Or right after a big meal. Do not do that. Otherwise, you can do this. Press here. It will be good.\nWhen I was young, when I first learned pain meditation, I could not find a particular pain. But then, the next day, we had this big prayer gathering. It was a long day, from morning until afternoon we had to sit there, and I had a lot of pain. Then I tried to practice pain meditation. In the beginning, it was quite good. I felt really nice. But then, in the end, I felt exhausted and tired.\nWe will try it together first. So please keep your meditation posture. Now rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please be aware of pain – if you do not have pain, then create pain – and watch. Do not create a strong pain. First, we have to start with light pain.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, rest your mind as it is. Just relax.\n[Silent meditation.]\nOkay, how was it? Normally, when you watch pain there are four experiences possible. First, when you watch the pain, the pain disappears. It dissolves. There is no pain! Then the mind loses focus, there is some kind of gap. So you stay with the gap. Stay with no pain. That is great!\nThe second experience is that the pain will change. Going from the knees to the back. From the back to the head. Even the head is changing and curving. That is great! That means pain has become your friend, it has become the object of your meditation.\nThe third experience is that when you look at the pain, the pain does not disappear, it does not become bigger, and it does not change. It is just there, and you can watch it. That is also good! Again, the pain has become a support for your meditation.\nThe last experience is that when you look at the pain, it becomes stronger, overwhelming. If you have this experience, then you need to change the focus – if it becomes overwhelming, or very strong, change the focus to sounds or the breath or a visual object. Then do not meditate on pain for a while. In the future, you can slowly come back. Practicing step by step. Then, eventually, you can make friends even with chronic pain. Eventually – but not at the beginning.\nThese are the four experiences. I hope you will be able to make friends with pain. If you like pain meditation or you are okay with pain meditation, then pain really becomes your friend. It is a great achievement! Congratulations! But, of course, with strong pain, you cannot practice. Like me, at first, in the big prayer gathering, I could meditate with pain, but, in the end, I felt exhausted. I could not. That is normal. Do not worry about that. We have to practice step by step. 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n140 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice\nTip\nDon't try to get rid of pain, but use it as a support for recognizing awareness.\nMeditating with Pain\nBegin session Begin by finding a comfortable posture.\nLet everything be, just as it is, letting the mind rest in open awareness for a few moments.\nBring a sense of meaning to your practice by setting an inspiring motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, to benefit not only myself, but also my friends, family, and society.\" Main practice Scan your body, and notice whether there are any places in which there are painful sensations. If there are no painful sensations, gently press the web between your thumb and index finger, only to the point where there is mild discomfort.\nKeep a light awareness of the sensation you are experiencing.\nYou may discover that the sensations change, move, disappear, or increase. Whatever takes place, simply allow it to happen as you rest in awareness, neither rejecting nor indulging the experience.\nDrop what you are doing, and simply rest in open awareness for a few moments.&nbsp;\nWhen you feel ready, come back to meditating with painful sensations.&nbsp;\nIf the sensation of pain gets too strong or overwhelming, shift to a more comfortable posture, being aware as you move.&nbsp; End Session Let go of what you are doing, and let everything be just as it is.&nbsp;\nEnd your session with a dedication, thinking, \"May this meditation benefit others, including my friends, family, and society.\" Have you been able to use pain or another difficult experience as support for meditation? If so, how does it change the way you relate to this experience?Do you find it easier or more difficult to use pain as a support for meditation compared to, for example, sound or a visual object? How do you experience this difference?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?In this reading, you will learn Mingyur Rinpoche's own story of his teaching telling him about the idea of self-antidotes.\nThe Joy of Living, pp. 147–149 &nbsp;(Ch. 11,&nbsp;\"Meditating on Painful Sensations\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.5 the Problem Is the Solution Application\" data-href=\"1.2.5 the Problem Is the Solution Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.5-the-problem-is-the-solution-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.5 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Pain (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Pain_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Pain</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Pain*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"},{"heading":"Reading (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.5-the-problem-is-the-solution-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.5-the-problem-is-the-solution-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474014,"modifiedTime":1759272585574,"sourceSize":7427,"sourcePath":"1.

You can use them as supports for meditation now. There is nothing that cannot become support for meditation. Except for one thing! Which is: forgetting to be aware. Otherwise, if you feel dull, then just be aware of dullness. If you feel agitated, you are just aware of that. If there is a lot of noise around, you can do sound meditation. If there are many things in front of you, you can be aware of them and it becomes meditation on visual objects. You can do this with everything! But, of course, in the beginning it is not so easy. You will fail. But failure is good! Because failure is the mother of success.&nbsp;\nWhen I was young, I was trying to meditate, and it was really difficult. One day, in the morning, I went to wash my face. We did not have hot water in the monastery, so we took a shower only at a warm temperature. After lunch, from time to time, we took a shower. We did not take a shower every day – but not one time per year, it was not like that. Once in a while. But every day we washed our faces. One day I went to wash my face, and a little drop of water went inside my ear. I tried to clean it. When I walked I felt like \"giri giri giri, gulu gulu gulu.\"\nI was struggling to remove this water and my teacher, Saljay Rinpoche, said, \"What are you doing?\" I told Saljay Rinpoche, \"A drop of water went into my ear, and I cannot get rid of it.\" And Saljay Rinpoche said, \"Use more water.\" I thought, \"Are you crazy?\" I did not say that, but I thought it. I asked Saljay Rinpoche, \"If just one drop of water makes me crazy, if I then put a lot of water, would that really be okay?\" Saljay Rinpoche said, \"It is okay. Try it!\" So then I put a lot of water, and I tilted my head, and all the water was gone. No more \"giri giri giri, gulu gulu gulu.\" I was surprised, and I asked Saljay Rinpoche, \"Why is that?\" Saljay Rinpoche said, \"This is an example of self-antidote. So, if you want an antidote to water, use water!\"\nIn Tibet, a traditional example is that peacocks eat poison. There is a kind of poison called, \"tsen dug.\" When a peacock eats that poison, it is good for the feathers. They get really bright. But for humans, we die.\nAnother example: if you get burned, do not put water right away. Little bit heat up the area around the burn, then it will heal more easily. Or another example: to cut a diamond, use a diamond. So like those examples.\nFor me, it was really fascinating to learn. I was really inspired by self-antidote. And I had this really good understanding of self-antidote. The best antidote is self-antidote. Or the best bodyguard is your enemy – if your enemy becomes your bodyguard, then you are very safe, right?\nThere is another story. When my father went to the hospital when he had an eye problem the nurse forgot to give him anesthesia. So when the doctor began the surgery, the muscles moved! Then the doctor found out that they had not given anesthesia.\nEven though it was really painful, my father was using pain as support for meditation. I am sure you cannot do that at the beginning.\nMy father used pain as support for meditation, but it was not easy. The end of the story is that the doctor was quite upset with the nurse, and they almost fired the nurse. But my father was really compassionate, and he asked the hospital not to fire the nurse. The nurse really appreciated it.\nBut when you are aware of pain, then you do not need to get rid of the pain. You do not need to do anything. You just use the pain as a support for your meditation – as a self-antidote.\nNext time, if you want to do that, if maybe you have a toothache and it is quite painful, you can put a painkiller next to you and then, when you have the pain here, meditate. And from time to time look at the painkiller. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] If you feel tired, then you can take the painkiller. I am just kidding – but something like that. We have to do it step by step.\nEventually, everything can become a support for our meditation. That is what we call, \"self-antidote,\" or \"self-liberation.\" Self-antidote is the best antidote. Self-liberation is the best way to liberate everything. The meaning of liberation is to free our mind.\nThank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow would you describe the term self-antidote in your own words? Question 2\nCan you come up with a few examples, other than the ones Mingyur Rinpoche used, for self-antidotes? Points to remember:\nThe meaning of the term \"self-antidote\" is that you use the very thing that troubles you as a support for meditation.\nAnother word for \"self-antidote\" is \"self-liberation\"\n\"Liberation\" means freeing your mind.\nIn this reading, you will learn Mingyur Rinpoche's own story of his teacher telling him about the idea of self-antidotes.\nJoyful Wisdom, pp. 21–27 &nbsp;(Ch. 1, \"Of Antidotes and Bodyguards\")\nInquiry\nHow can I use what troubles me as a support for meditation?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.5 the Problem Is the Solution Meditation\" data-href=\"1.2.5 the Problem Is the Solution Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.5-the-problem-is-the-solution-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.5 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Self-Antidote (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Self-Antidote_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Self-Antidote</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Self-Antidote*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(10_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.5-the-problem-is-the-solution-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.5-the-problem-is-the-solution-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474002,"modifiedTime":1759272585595,"sourceSize":6055,"sourcePath":"1.

Sleeping meditation really helps, especially when you feel dull, unclear, bored, and tired – all these feelings can be supports for meditation. With sleeping meditation, even if you are not completely successful, it really helps the meditation experience go to a deeper level of your mind – to the unconscious or subconscious mind. It becomes a deep transformation.&nbsp;\nHow do you practice sleeping meditation? For sleeping meditation, you need to feel sleepy. Do you feel sleepy now? If you feel sleepy, tired, bored, or drowsy – that is great! You are lucky! If you do not have that, you are not eligible to practice now. Anyway, we will try it out now, and later when you feel any of those, you can practice. Is that not amazing?\nNormally, we think feeling tired, bored, or dull is useless, right? But now you can make friends with them, and they can become quite beneficial for meditation. Sometimes I call this, \"inner recycling.\" Do you know what this is? The junk things in your mind can transform, even strong negative emotions. But I will teach meditation with emotions later.\nWhat we are going to do is that first, I will do a demonstration. I will create some drama. [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers and the backdrop goes dark.] Okay! [Mingyur Rinpoche puts his robe over his head.] First, relax your body and mind, and close your eyes – I am doing this, now not you. For now, you just look at me. When you relax, sometimes you feel sleepy if you are lucky. What do I feel now? I feel relaxed. Now, I am dropping all the tension from my muscles. I am not smiling. Let everything drop and just be. Now I am feeling a little bit sleepy. Be aware of sleepiness, or tiredness, boredom, or whatever. [Mingyur Rinpoche appears to be drifting into sleep.] Continue to be aware. [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to fall asleep and starts to snore and then laughs.]\nSo, what will happen is that if you continue to maintain awareness with sleepiness, dullness, or any other feeling, then sleep will come. [Mingyur Rinpoche makes a demonstration with his hands.] A little bit alert, a little bit sleepy, a little bit alert, continue to be aware. In the end, you fall asleep. [Mingyur Rinpoche grabs one hand with the other to show how sleep catches awareness.] The moment you fall asleep, sleep will catch awareness, the meditation. Then all sleep becomes meditation. If you sleep for one hour, you are meditating for one hour. How nice, right? But, if first, you are aware, and then, at the moment of falling asleep, your mind thinks of pizza, then sleep does not catch the meditative state of mind. Then that becomes normal sleep.\nWhat we are going to do now is to practice together. First, cover your eyes. [Mingyur Rinpoche puts his robe over his head.] Do not cover your nose – you need to be able to breathe.\nBegin with the right meditation posture.\nNow, relax and rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please be aware of sleepiness, dullness, boredom, tiredness, or any other feeling. Just be with it. Feel it. Observe it.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please open your eyes and take off the shawl.\nHow was it? How many of you feel when you watch sleepiness, it goes away? That is great! Then be with alertness. There is a gap in the mind. Or if you can be with sleepiness and are able to sleep, that is very good! But, at night, if you watch sleepiness and it goes away, then do not practice this one.\nAt night, when you are really going to sleep, just lie down and rest your mind in open awareness – rest as it is. Or use awareness of the body – doing a body scan from head to feet. Relax your whole body and sleep. This is also good for sleep, and it becomes sleeping meditation.\nWhat are the signs of sleeping meditation? There are two signs. One is that when you wake up, you wake up in meditation. The moment you wake up, you are already in meditation. That is the first sign. The second sign of sleeping meditation is that there are no dreams. If these two come together, that means sleep is transformed into meditation. But, in the beginning, you do not know while you sleep that you are in meditation.\nMy teacher, Saljey Rinpoche, always held a Tibetan prayer wheel in one hand and his mala in the other – \"Om mani padme hum...\" And then he would go like this: [Mingyur Rinpoche mimes his teacher drifting into sleep and snoring, then waking up] \"Om mani padme hum...\"\nOne time, there were five of us asking him for a very long teaching, going on for months. At almost the end of the teaching, he said, \"Maybe we will finish tomorrow. Maybe the day after tomorrow.\" The next day, he said, \"Okay, we will finish today.\" Normally, the tradition is that at the end of a teaching, we do a long dedication. There is one particular dedication prayer that is quite long, and we were supposed to memorize that prayer. I had already memorized it and my friends all did as well, so we did not bring the text. So, Saljey Rinpoche begun the dedication [Mingyur Rinpoche begins to chant,] and then we all prayed. Then, a few sentences later, Saljey Rinpoche became like this: [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to fall asleep.] He fell asleep. The five of us continued to pray, but in the middle of the prayer, we got lost, because we did not have the text. We all became quiet and looked at each other. Then Saljey Rinpoche woke up and continued the next sentence. We were all shocked. And then we prayed from memory and he fell asleep again.\nWhat happens is that in the beginning when you practice sleeping meditation, you do not know you are in sleeping meditation. After a certain level, you know. Your body becomes paralyzed, and you are asleep, but you can hear.\nSometimes, we had interviews with the Saljey Rinpoche, and some people had long stories. In the beginning, Saljey Rinpoche would say, \"Okay. Yeah, yeah…\" and fell asleep. Then, most people kept quiet, but we knew about this, so we continued to ask questions – one, two, three, etc. In the end, when all the questions were finished, he would wake up and give you an answer – a very clear one. Sometimes, we asked questions while he was asleep, and the answers became more clear!\nThis is sleeping meditation. But this is quite difficult for us. You cannot really transform sleep into meditation, right away. But even if you cannot transform sleep into meditation, if in the process of falling asleep you can meditate like this, it really helps the unconscious or subconscious mind – a deeper level of your mind will transform – and the meditation really makes a good imprint in the deeper level of your mind. 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n140 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice\nTip\nEvery night as you go to sleep, simply rest in open awareness. With practice, you will experience sleeping meditation.\nFalling Asleep with Awareness\nBegin session As you lie down in bed, notice how your body feels. Scan through your body and see whether you find any areas of tension.\nBring a sense of meaning to your practice by setting an inspiring motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, to benefit not only myself, but also my friends, family, and society.\" Main practice Next, notice the sensation of your breathing. Feel the breath as in moves in and out of your body.\nTake a few deep breaths and then be aware of the sensation of your body resting on the bed. Notice how your body is supported by the bed. Perhaps you feel the weight of your body sinking into the bed. Just notice this sensation.&nbsp;\nNow, slowly send your awareness through your body, starting from your head, moving down toward your feet and toes. Notice any sleepiness or lethargy in the different areas of your body. Simply notice what this feels like.\nBring your awareness back to the breath. Take a few deep breaths and as you exhale, feel how you are sinking deeper into the bed.\nContinue to feel the sensations in your body. You are not trying to feel any particular way. You are simply exploring what your body feels like, right now.&nbsp;\nWherever you feel sleepiness in your body, rest your awareness there.&nbsp; End Session Completely let go of the practice, and simply be. You do not have to pay attention or try to do anything. Simply rest, just as you are, right now.\nAs you continue to drift off to sleep, continue practicing, keeping a very light awareness of the feelings in your body.\nLet awareness accompany you as you drift off to sleep. Are you able to practice sleeping meditation? If yes, how is your experience? If no, what is it that you find challenging?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.6 the Ups and Downs of Meditation Application\" data-href=\"1.2.6 the Ups and Downs of Meditation Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.6-the-ups-and-downs-of-meditation-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.6 Meditation","sleeping meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Sleep and Sleepiness (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Sleep_and_Sleepiness_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Sleep and Sleepiness</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Sleep_and_Sleepiness*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.6-the-ups-and-downs-of-meditation-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.6-the-ups-and-downs-of-meditation-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473972,"modifiedTime":1759272585631,"sourceSize":9792,"sourcePath":"1.

Up is good, and down is good. My teachers told me that, in Tibet, when people want to go from eastern Tibet to central Tibet – to Lhasa – there are a lot of ups and downs. Because Tibet is a land of mountains. So, sometimes you have to go up, then you have to go down. When you go up, you are getting closer to Lhasa, and when going down, you are also getting closer to Lhasa. Both are good. They are part of the journey.\nWhen you meditate, at first you may feel a little bit peaceful and nice. Then, after some time, the peaceful experience is gone. Then what you have is rough experiences – a lot of thoughts and emotions come. It looks like your mind is getting worse than before. But this is a good sign! Then, after some time, again the mind becomes peaceful and joyful.\nFor these ups and downs, what are the up experiences, and what are the down experiences? There are three up experiences. Being joyful – like feeling joy, love, and being peaceful. That is one. The second is clarity. Your mind becomes very clear, vivid, and fresh. And, third, non-conceptual mind, meaning not so much thought. The mind becomes very calm and quiet. Regarding these three – sometimes there is more joy, more clarity, or more non-conceptuality – they change. These are the up experiences. But these experiences do not last long, just a few hours, sometimes just minutes, or sometimes even days. They stay for a little bit longer, and then they are gone.\nThen you have rough experiences. There are two rough experiences. One is dullness. Dullness means your mind becomes really flat and there is no taste. All the joy, calm, and peace are gone and you feel a little bit dry. You do not feel satisfied. You feel really dissatisfied with your meditation. Although, you have awareness! As soon as you try to meditate, awareness is right there, but we do not feel satisfied by that. We are looking for a particular experience. Sometimes you feel sleepy also. The moment you meditate, you fall asleep. These belong to dullness.\nAnother down experience is what we call, \"agitation.\" Agitation has a lot of thoughts. Waves of strong emotions come, like hatred, panic, anxiety, depression, etc. All of these come. None of these are bad. They are good!\nAwareness, actually, does not change. With the ups, there is awareness, with the downs, there is awareness. So, we have to come back to awareness. We have to try to remind ourselves that even if we do not have the taste of meditation, we still have awareness. Be with awareness, and do not worry about the ups and downs. This is really important!\nWe say, \"Do not be attached to the meditation experience.\" Do not be attached to it. What is the meaning of attachment? When they have a peaceful experience like joy or clarity, some people think, \"Oh, now I achieved a high level of meditation experience, I will get enlightened now!\" Or you expect to stay like this forever. \"From today on, I would like to have this state all the time. Now, I am free from negative emotions and thoughts.\" These two – the first being that you think this experience is the best, the second is that you are expecting it to last forever. This is grasping.\nDo not think, \"This is enlightenment.\" Right now, it is not. It is a process, right? And do not think that it will be like this forever. You have to recognize that this is an experience, and it will change – it is going up and down, like the stock market. Then there is no problem. If you have a wonderful experience, you can appreciate that wonderful experience. If it is very nice, feel happy about that. But who knows, after a few minutes or hours, it may change. That is okay! That attitude will be really good.\nSo, one's meditation experience always goes up and down. But there is another thing that we call, \"realization.\" Realization develops slowly, slowly. You do not even know how much you have changed, how much you have improved. For example: between days 1‒30, if you meditate every day, there are improvements. But you do not see it on a day-to-day basis. But when you look back, then you see the improvement.\nRealization does not change. But you also do not feel it. Realization does not have a \"taste,\" so you do not feel it. Realization is like learning how to swim. Once you know how to swim, for the rest of your life, you will know how to swim. It is like that. It develops slowly, slowly, but once you know, it does not change. But meditation experience always changes – going up and down, up and down – just like the stock market.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says we should not worry about the ups and downs of meditation but simply stay with awareness. Why is this? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche says that the down experiences are not bad, but actually good. What do you think he means by this? Points to remember:\nThe three up experiences: joy\nclarity\nnon-conceptuality The two down experiences: dullness\nagitation Awareness is present in both the ups and downs of practice.\nDo not grasp at experiences but stay with the essence.\nRealization never changes.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow to avoid mistaking experience for realization\na story about Mingyur Rinpoche's father\nhow to work with bliss, clarity, and non-conceptuality in meditation\nhow to avoid becoming attached to meditative experiences The Joy of Living, pp. 217–220 &nbsp;(Ch. 15, \"Mistaking Experience for Realization\")\nTip\nWhether you have an up or down experience, ask yourself, \"How can I use this experience to recognize awareness?\"\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.6 the Ups and Downs of Meditation Meditation\" data-href=\"1.2.6 the Ups and Downs of Meditation Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.6-the-ups-and-downs-of-meditation-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.6 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Ups and Downs in Practice (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Ups_and_Downs_in_Practice_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Ups and Downs in Practice</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Ups_and_Downs_in_Practice*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.6-the-ups-and-downs-of-meditation-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.6-the-ups-and-downs-of-meditation-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473967,"modifiedTime":1759272585645,"sourceSize":6600,"sourcePath":"1.

Especially when the weather is a little bit hot, or I feel tired, or sometimes I am in a place where I do not feel fresh, then I take a shower. When I take a shower, the sensation of coolness or warmth going through the whole body is almost like awareness is scanning the body – not just with the mind but together with the water. But do not stay in the water for too long. Do not waste too much water. Anyway, when you take a shower, this practice is really good!\nAlso, when you are walking, be aware of it. As well as when you are eating or when you are in meetings. Some people say, \"Oh, I cannot meditate, because I have a very tight schedule, and I have to go to meetings. I have to go to work, and I have deadlines. Then, when I come back home, sometimes I need to watch my television, and I need to answer all the emails.\"\nBut for meditation, it is okay! There is nothing that can clash with your schedule, because you can meditate everywhere, anytime, under any circumstances. Right? Short times, many times. You can meditate in your office while you are doing your job. You can meditate while looking at your phone – and maybe, who knows, whenever you watch your phone, that could become a habit of meditating while watching your phone. That would be nice, no?\nAlso, if you exercise. Normally, I exercise. I hike. I like hiking, and when I reach the top, \"Haah!\" Open awareness. Just relax. The mind becomes so vivid, fresh, and clear. And that is really good for meditation. The state of mind is really calm. You do not have to do anything. It is almost like the meditative state comes automatically, and you just be with it.\nThese small things are really important. Normally, we take them for granted, or we do not consider them important. Of course, sitting meditation – formal meditation – is really important. But informal meditation is also important. Informal meditation really helps to build the habit of meditation, and it really helps to transform everyday life into support for meditation.\nEspecially when you are facing difficult situations – a stressful or strong emotional situation. When you are having a lot of strong emotions, maybe relationship problems, whatever kind of problem, it is very difficult to meditate during these problems – but, if you try, the benefit is very strong.\nNow, we will do one simple meditation exercise. How about talking meditation? If you have a friend or someone with you, talk to each other, okay? Or – if you do not have somebody – maybe you can call someone, or maybe you can just talk to yourself. Why not? Or just pray. Or read a book – grab a book and read out loud using your voice, and then meditate. Okay? Pause my video and you can do this. Okay?\nHow was it? I did drinking meditation.\nI hope this will be of benefit to you.\nNow, this is finished!\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesFor this section, you will use two situations as support for meditation: one is taking a shower, and the other is being engaged in conversations.Instructions for meditating while showering\nWhen taking a shower, feel the sensations of the water landing on your body. Feel the warmth or coolness of the water going from the top of your head down to your feet, or wherever the sensation is strongest.\nYou can also alternate between hot and cold in order to observe the feeling. Try to relate to the hot and cold as mere \"feelings\" and notice whether you have any spontaneous judgements of these feelings as being either good or bad.\nInstructions for meditating with conservingTake a few moments to think of a person with whom you are frequently in conversation. Think of when these conversations will take place in the following days and set an intention to use these conversations as opportunities to practice meditation in everyday life. All you have to do while talking is to know that you are talking. That's it! Do not over-analyze this so that the other person starts to wonder what you are doing. Remain completely normal, and as you talk and listen, be aware that you are doing so.How was your experience of meditating while taking a shower? Describe your experience and any insights or challenges you encountered.What happens when you apply awareness while engaging in conversation? How does it affect your experience of interacting with the other person?What do you do to remember to use conversations as support for meditation in everyday life?In this reading, you will learn:\nhow informal practice supports formal practice\nhow to make a plan for your informal meditation\nthe main benefits of informal practice The Joy of Living, pp. 200–203 &nbsp;(Ch. 14, \"Informal Practice\")\nTip\nTaking a break from meditation from time to time is an important part of the practice.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.7 Energy Movement Summary\" data-href=\"1.2.7 Energy Movement Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.7-energy-movement-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.7 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating in Everyday Life</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_in_Everyday_Life*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"},{"heading":"Step 3","level":3,"id":"Step_3_0"},{"heading":"Journal Reflection Question 1","level":3,"id":"Journal_Reflection_Question_1_0"},{"heading":"Journal Reflection Question 2","level":3,"id":"Journal_Reflection_Question_2_0"},{"heading":"Journal Reflection Question 3","level":3,"id":"Journal_Reflection_Question_3_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.7-energy-movement-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.7-energy-movement-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473953,"modifiedTime":1759272585663,"sourceSize":5824,"sourcePath":"1.

As you breathe in, simply know that you are breathing in. As you breathe out, simply know that you are breathing out. In the natural pause between exhalation and inhalation, just rest in open awareness, letting everything be as it is.\nThere is no need to block other experiences, nor do you have to engage them. Just let them move through awareness as you keep your attention on the breathing.\nDrop what you are doing and rest for a few moments in the present moment.\nWhen you feel ready, become aware of your breathing again and rest naturally between breaths. End Session Let go of the focus on the breath, and just rest in open awareness for a few moments.\nEnd your session with a dedication, thinking, \"May this meditation benefit others, including my friends, family, and society.\" Do you experience any difference practicing with open awareness here compared to in section 3?

About 10% of people who meditate have this energy movement. Many people do not know that it is energy movement. If you do not know you are having these energy movements, you will get stuck. So what I want to share with you is really important.&nbsp;\nSo, what is this energy movement? Energy movement happens when we begin to meditate, and there is a lot of transformation happening in the body and, of course, in the mind, but most of it is in the body.\nSome people feel it in their bodies. Actually, energy movement is not bad. There can be a transformation in the body, like in the nerves, energy, cells, or what we call, \"prana, bindu, nadi.\" All of these are transforming.\nThere are four things with regards to energy movement. The first sign of energy movement is like when you feel heat at the top of your head. You feel heat moving, opening, closing, or in your spine or your back, like an electric shock coming, going up, or a tingling movement, going up and down your spine. Or from your stomach, there is a heat or a strong emotion accompanying the heat, or inside your body there is a vibration that comes like something is moving inside your body, and your energy goes up. Some people are affected in their bodies like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche rapidly rocks from side to side.] Some people even experience uncontrolled movements or pressure in their hearts, throats, and in their foreheads. And sometimes people just want to cry, without any reason. These are the physical signs of energy movement.\nThe second one is sensory perceptions. You see something, dots or different colors, or sometimes visions – visions of enlightened beings, or visions of ghosts. Sometimes people hear sounds or music or messages – messages from ghosts or enlightened beings. There can be smells, tastes, sensations, or any of the five sensory perceptions.\nThe third is sensing energy. You feel, \"Oh, here is positive energy,\" or \"Here is negative energy. This person has positive energy. This teacher has positive energy. Wow! I am getting all this positive energy from this enlightened being or teacher,\" or \"That person or teacher has bad energy,\" or \"The ghost over there is giving me obstacles.\" It is something like that with sensing energy.\nThe last one is when emotions are going up and down. Sometimes you are very happy, sometimes you are not, or sometimes a strong negative emotion comes. Sometimes joy, bliss, or clarity comes. There are a lot of ups and downs.\nAmong these four, two are real and two are not. The ones that are real are the sign of energy movement in the body and the emotions going up and down. But the other two are not real. The sensory perceptions are not real. Seeing enlighted beings or ghosts – do not care about that. Treat it just as when you are watching TV – 3D TV. The forms and sounds all come together, seeming so real as if you were there in front of the enlighted being or the ghost. But do not care about this. Treat it just like watching 3D TV – like IMAX. Do not care about it. Even listening to voices that tell you, \"Oh, you are so important! You have come to this world to save it,\" or bad voices like, \"You are not good! You are bad,\" or if it feels like someone is spying on you, do not care about it. Do not listen to those voices. The same is true for smell and taste – they are all the same. It is very important to not believe in and care about those things.\nAlso, sensing energy is not real. Sometimes you feel some energy, and it feels like you can read others' minds, but do not believe in this.\nIt can be very difficult if you have been stuck in this mindset, and it has happened for a long time. It is not easy to let it go. But try, slowly, slowly. Eventually, it will go away.\nThe most important thing is to know about energy movement. If you do not know about it, then you might think, \"Oh, I am finally going to get enlightened now,\" or some people might think, \"I am going crazy!\" You are not going crazy, and you are not enlightened. Yet... [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It is just energy movement, which is good, but do not care about it.\nSo, what do you have to do if you have these energy movements? You do not have to do anything. The most important thing is to recognize it. You are not enlighted. You are not crazy. It is just energy movement.\nAnother thing: if the energy movement gets very strong after meditating, then do not meditate. Stop meditating for two or three weeks. Do physical exercise: jogging, hiking – aerobic exercise – and drink a lot of water. Then, come back to meditation little by little – short times, many times. That is okay. There is no problem. This is really important to know.\nEnergy movement is not bad. It is just a process of transforming your body and mind.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWhat are the four signs of energy movement and their respective characteristics? Question 2\nIf a friend is experiencing the signs of sensory perceptions and/or sensing energy, how would you explain that these are not to be taken seriously? Points to remember:\nThe four signs of energy movement: Physical signs\nSensory perceptions\nSensing energy\nFluctuating emotions The true and false signs: The physical signs and fluctuating emotions = True\nSensory perceptions and sensing energy = False If you experience energy movement, all you have to do is recognize it.\nWhen energy movements are strong, take a break from meditation and do some physical exercise.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.7 Energy Movement Meditation\" data-href=\"1.2.7 Energy Movement Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.7-energy-movement-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.7 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Energy Movement (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Energy_Movement_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Energy Movement</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Energy_Movement*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.7-energy-movement-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.7-energy-movement-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473923,"modifiedTime":1759272585698,"sourceSize":6375,"sourcePath":"1.

The answer is that we have developed a very strong identification with our monkey-mind. In order to shift our identity to our natural awareness, we need aids, supports, and methods. We all need these strategies, but don't confuse them with the true meaning of meditation. We are not training in order to to learn about objects. We are training to learn about our mind, because our mind holds the source of all possibilities—good and bad, happy and sad, sane and neurotic. Freedom exists within our very own heart and mind.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesThink of a situation that seems appropriate for practicing mental recitation in daily life. It can be while driving to work, while walking your dog, cooking, or any other situation you can think of. Pick a specific situation and decide to practice while engaged in this activity. As usual, remind yourself in the morning and check in before going to bed how it went. Repeat again the next day.Journal Reflection Question 1Do you find it easier or more difficult to recite the word or phrase while engaging in daily-life activities versus in formal meditation?Journal Reflection Question 2Do you notice any impact from this practice while engaging in the activity you choose?

So I ran away from my home. Near my home, we had a small cave. I ran to the cave, and I sat there pretending that I was meditating, even though I had no idea about meditation. I just sat there, and after some time I fell asleep. My grandma was very worried. She was taking care of me, and suddenly I was lost. She called everyone in the village, and they all came together and looked for me. And then my grandma said, \"Do not do that next time!\" But I did not listen. I ran away again.\nOne day, I went to the cave and my grandma knew it was nearby, so if I was lost she could come and get me there, and then she was okay. I sat there in the cave and what I did was to recite a mantra. In my hometown, we used a lot of mantras. I recited a mantra in my mind. A mantra is a kind of prayer, a form of prayer. I recited it in my mind without using my lips. I felt good! Later, when I was nine, I asked my father, \"Saying the mantra in my mind, without using my lips, is that meditation or not?\" My father said, \"Yes!\" I was so happy!\nThis meditation, which we call, \"mental recitation,\" is very easy. It is beneficial for me, and I hope it will be of benefit to you. Especially if you do not know whether you are meditating or not, then it is good to do this mental recitation. Because you are not using your mouth and lips, so you have to recite in your mind. And when you recite this prayer, or whatever verses, in your mind, then you have to use awareness. Without awareness, you cannot recite. So it automatically becomes meditation.\nWhat kind of prayer or verses can you use? You can use anything. If you have a religion, and in your religion, if you have any prayers, you can do that. Or if you do not have a religion and you do not know any prayers or mantras, you can just use a verse. Now here, as an example, we will use a verse. Here we will use the phrase: \"I am fine. Everything is fine.\" We will say that in the mind – but do not move your lips or tongue, okay?\nWe will practice together.\nPlease keep your meditation posture, and rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please say these words in your mind. You do not have to worry about the meaning. Just say it in your mind, \"I am fine. Everything is fine.\" Say this in your mind.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow rest your mind. Just be as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nHow was it?\nThis is mental recitation. You can practice this anywhere, anytime. And, again, the essence of meditation is awareness, and we have many different techniques. If this feels suitable for you, then you can do this one until you feel bored – then you need to change it and do another meditation technique. 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n140 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nTip\nJust know that when you recite a word or phrase, you are automatically in meditation.\nMeditating with Mental Recitation\nBegin session Take a moment to find a comfortable, balanced posture. Be upright, but also relaxed and at ease.\nNotice the sensations in your body. See whether you notice any tension in your body. Then, take a few deep breaths and allow the tension to relax.\nLet go of the doing energy of the mind and simply be. Just rest in open awareness for a few moments.\nBring a sense of meaning to your practice by setting an inspiring motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, not only to benefit myself but also my friends, family, and society.\" Main practice Choose a word or phrase that you find inspiring, like \"I am fine. Everything is fine,\" and slowly repeat it in your mind.\nNotice the sound of the word or phrase you are repeating in your mind, almost like a sound you are listening to, and rest your awareness gently on that sound, as you would with an object.&nbsp;\nWhen you notice you have been distracted, you are already back in awareness and can continue where you left off.&nbsp;\nLet go of the mental recitation and just rest in open, effortless awareness for a few moments.&nbsp;\nWhenever you feel ready, pick up the mental recitation again. You can use the same word or phrase as before or pick a new one. Whatever you choose, just be aware of the sound in your mind as you repeat it over and over again.&nbsp;\nNotice whether your experience changes if you speed up or slow down the recitation.&nbsp; End Session Gently open your eyes if they have been closed. Drop the mental recitation and just rest in open awareness for the last few moments of your practice.\nEnd your session with a dedication, thinking, \"May this meditation benefit others, including my friends, family, and society.\" How is reciting a word or phrase silently in your mind different from working with any of the previous practices?Does it make a difference whether you recite the word or phrase out loud or silently in your mind?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.8 Key Points of Meditation Application\" data-href=\"1.2.8 Key Points of Meditation Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.8-key-points-of-meditation-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.8 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Mental Recitation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Mental_Recitation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Mental Recitation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Mental_Recitation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.8-key-points-of-meditation-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.8-key-points-of-meditation-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473905,"modifiedTime":1759272585730,"sourceSize":6053,"sourcePath":"1.

First is what we call the \"waterfall experience,\" the second is the \"riverlike experience,\" and the third is the \"lake without waves experience.\" These are the three.&nbsp;\nThe first – the waterfall experience – is when you begin to learn meditation. In the beginning, you may feel something good. Then, after some time, you get lost, your meditation is gone, you do not feel anything. Or some people, in the beginning, feel it is all nonsense. \"This does not make any sense! What is awareness?\" Or if you try to listen to sounds, or be aware of sensations in your body, you do not know if you are doing it right or wrong. \"How can I tell if I am meditating or not?\" Something like that.\nWhen I was young, the first time I was meditating, I felt a little bit dizzy, and I felt like the cushion was moving, and it did not make any sense to me – in the beginning. My mind was all over the place, and I felt like being in the air.\nOne day, my father was teaching meditation to many students, to a lot of Westerners – about 150 of them. They did a course over five days. In that teaching, my father taught them about awareness. He said, \"Awareness is just knowing.\" He normally had a mala, and he was saying, \"If you rest your mind, it is like this...\" [Mingyur Rinpoche holds the mala in his hands and then let go of it.] Just drop the mala, let it be. That day, I had some kind of taste of meditation, \"Aha!\" On that day, I connected with meditation, which was really feeling good. But then, the next day, it was gone.\nSome days, I felt a lot of calm, the whole body became a little bit peaceful and joyful. Some days, I felt dull – the moment of meditating I felt sleepy. And some days, my mind was restless. I felt like I meditated for twenty minutes but, actually, it was only ten or five minutes – even one minute was difficult. That is agitation. There is a lot of ups and downs. The \"ups\" have a feeling of joy, clarity, and non-conceptuality. There are three kinds of \"ups\" meditation experiences. The \"downs\" are dullness, sleepiness – or even if you are not sleepy, you do not know what you are doing. The mind becomes very fuzzy, with no taste of meditation. Agitation means that the mind becomes restless, or there are so many emotions.\nThis is the waterfall experience. So why do we call it the \"waterfall experience?\" Because you begin to see a lot of things in your mind. Actually, it is a good sign. But, normally, thoughts, emotions, and ourselves are one. We are the emotion. We are the problem. We are the thought. But now, when we meditate, it begins to separate. The mind begins to be calm and clear, so you begin to see those things. That is why we call it the \"waterfall experience.\"\nThe second stage of meditation experience is the \"riverlike experience.\" For the riverlike meditation experience, as you meditate, again and again, you connect more and more with awareness. You see that awareness is the background of thoughts, emotions, perceptions, memories, etc.\nAll these are being held in awareness. Awareness does not change. If you go up, there is awareness, and if you go down there is awareness, right? You can connect with awareness when you are feeling dull. If you know you are dull and you be with it, that is it! If you feel agitated, the mind becomes busier and busier, \"Ah, I know, you are busy.\" That is awareness, too. If you are completely confused, \"Ah yeah, I am confused,\" that is awareness, too. Or if you feel a little bit sleepy and just watch the sleepiness. So, everything becomes supports for meditation. Basically, your mind is just like a river: it continues, but still, there are a lot of ups and downs, the mind is moving, but it is okay. It is also easier to enter into meditation; whenever you want to meditate, there are still ups and downs, but you can meditate.\nBasically, your mind becomes calmer, more free, and more peaceful, and the mind becomes more pliable and workable. The monkey mind begins to build a habit to listen to you more and more. Therefore, you have some kind of freedom over the monkey mind.\nThen, if you continue to meditate, the last meditation experience is what we call the \"ocean without waves\" or \"lake without waves.\" Here, your mind becomes calm, clear, and non-conceptual. It does not mean you have no thoughts. The mind is normally grasping. It is stuck like glue onto everything. But here, you will not be stuck, you will be free. This is the non-conceptual experience: you are not being trapped in thoughts, emotions, and all of these things, even though you might have thoughts, emotions, and all these things.\n\"Joyful\" means that there is some kind of contentment at a deeper level, even though you are facing a lot of problems. At a deeper level, there is a feeling of contentment, joy, clarity, and non-conceptuality all the time.\nIf you really meditate strongly, even while you are sleeping, all the sleep becomes meditation. In the end, it continues for twenty-four hours a day. That is what we call, \"lake without waves.\" That is the final experience of meditation from using this technique and practice – it is the final meditation experience.\nAt that moment, your mind becomes not only peaceful and calm but also pliable and workable, and everything becomes support for awareness. Awareness is calm, pure, and free. Awareness is the real source of happiness, and that happiness does not depend on outside circumstances. Happiness comes from within.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWhat are the three stages of meditation experience, and what are their characteristics? Question 2\nWhat do you think Mingyur Rinpoche means when he says that awareness is the real source of happiness? Points to remember:\nThe three stages of meditation experience: waterfall\nriver\nlake without waves Awareness is the real source of happiness.\nIn this reading, you will learn more about the three stages of meditation experience\nThe Joy of Living, pp. 212–217 &nbsp;(Ch. 15, \"Progressive Stages of Meditation Practice\")\nInquiry\nWhat should I do when the waterfall experience is strong?\nWatch Read\nIn general, when we meditate with this style of meditation of our lineage, there are three qualities to meditation. The first is non-meditation, where you do not have to meditate. There is no need to block thoughts. There is no need to create a special state of mind of peace, clarity, or non-conceptuality. You do not have to do anything; not meditating, but not distracted – you do not get lost (which is the second point.)&nbsp;\nThere is a sense of awareness. Whatever kind of meditation you are doing, for example, listening to sound, as long as you do not forget the sound, if thoughts come and go does not matter. &nbsp;You do not need to block thoughts. You do not need to create a special, blissful, or joyful state of mind. You are not meditating, but neither are you forgetting the thought, so you are not lost. All meditation techniques are like that. &nbsp;\nThe third important aspect is what we call \"being uncontrived,\" or \"being natural\" – completely natural. This is really important! For example, when you meditate on sound, some days when you listen to sound, your mind feels calm – there is a feeling of love, joy, and peace. But on other days, you do not. When you listen to sound, you feel a little bit dull or unclear. Some days when you listen to sound, so many thoughts come – blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada. On some days when you listen to sound, there are a lot of emotions. So there are many different states of mind.\nAs a meditator, do not try to change your state of mind. As long as you can hear sounds, you can listen to them while being dull, while feeling joy, while having a lot of thoughts, or while feeling clear or non-conceptual – it does not matter.\nMany of us have a tendency to always associate meditation with peace, clarity, and non-conceptuality. &nbsp;This is a mistake. Although peace, clarity, and non-conceptuality are all experiences of meditation, they are not the essence of meditation. &nbsp;The essence of meditation is awareness. Awareness is the knowing quality of mind. If you continue to know the sound, you are fine. &nbsp;It is the same with sensations, breathing, visual objects, and open presence. If you just let be in open presence, you are not lost. &nbsp;There is a sense of being and presence, although you are not meditating. It is completely natural. Whatever the state of your mind is, it is okay.\nIt is important not to worry too much about these things. \"Do I have all these three qualities, or not? Am I meditating? Am I contriving?\" As long as you are not getting lost; just be natural, and everything is there.\nSometimes, my teachers would say that meditation is actually easier than drinking water. If you want to drink water, first you have to raise your hand and grab the cup, then you have to bring the cup close to your mouth, then you have to open your lips, then you have to drink and swallow, and then you have to put the cup back. There are a lot of things to do. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] However, with meditation, there is nothing to do! Just be, as it is. It is very easy.\nBut, the problem is that it is too easy. Sometimes when it is too easy, it becomes difficult. If it is too close, we cannot see it. Although you are in awareness, you are not satisfied with this, so you begin to contrive–to do something. But there is no need to do this. Just let go. Drop all this. Just be natural.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.2.8 Key Points of Meditation Meditation\" data-href=\"1.2.8 Key Points of Meditation Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.8-key-points-of-meditation-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.2.8 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Three Levels of Experience (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Three_Levels_of_Experience_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Three Levels of Experience</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Three_Levels_of_Experience*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"Bonus Material (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Bonus_Material_(5_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Three Qualities of Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Three_Qualities_of_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.8-key-points-of-meditation-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.2/1.2.8-key-points-of-meditation-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800473889,"modifiedTime":1759272585744,"sourceSize":10707,"sourcePath":"1.

When we begin to identify with that timeless, pristine awareness rather than with the thoughts, feelings, and sensations that pass through it, we've taken the first step toward facing the freedom of our true nature.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nCongratulations!\nNow you have finished these courses. This is the last one. I am very happy that you have been practicing this continuously until now.\nThese practices only have two central principles. The first one is that you connect with your fundamental nature. Your nature is always peaceful, pure, and it is always there. It is awesome and complete. Just recognize that. How to recognize this? In these level one courses, we are trying to recognize our fundamental nature through awareness. You know by now that awareness is with you 24/7. It does not matter if you are happy or not happy, clear or unclear, confused or not — it does not matter. Up or down — it does not matter. Awareness is like the sky, and thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and the ups and downs of our lives are like clouds. How wonderful, right?\nYou do not need to block the clouds. You do not need to change anything about your thoughts, emotions — positive or negatives ones — stress, peace, panic, joy, etc. You do not have to do anything with them. You do not have to block them. You do not have to create a special state of mind. Without doing anything with them, you are free from them. This is self-freedom or self-liberation. This is the first thing.\nThe second principle is that to connect with our true nature, the awareness, we are using many different supports, different objects like forms, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, thoughts, emotions — there is nothing that cannot become a support for your meditation. In a way, you are becoming friends with all phenomena, with everything. In the end, all this becomes a support for happiness, a support for joy, so that you can live your life joyfully.\nI learned these practices, and I did them step-by-step, even though I was very lazy when I was young. But, in the end, I even made friends with my panic. So it is possible. We are all the same. If you continue to practice, you can do that, too.\nThe next important thing is to not forget your homework. You have homework. Every day you have to practice. Also, there is informal meditation. You can meditate everywhere, anytime, under any circumstances, especially when you are facing problems or emotions. You know, in our lives, a lot of things happen. So, practice while you are walking, talking, eating, doing your daily job — anytime.\nWe also have an app — the Tergar app. You can use this app. Many people sometimes forget to write down their practice, and they forget to count how long they practiced and how much they have finished. They do not know. The app will memorize everything. Using the app can also be good and beneficial. If you really do not want to use the app, then you can write or whatever.\nThen, you should join level two. Level two is about love and compassion, which is wonderful!\nThank you very much and see you soon! See you in the next level!\nLucas Henriksson Myoshin Kelley <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Level 2 Opening the Heart\" data-href=\"Level 2 Opening the Heart\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/level-2-opening-the-heart.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Go to Next Course →</a>","aliases":["1.3 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course (12 min)","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_(12_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Conclusion of the Course</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Conclusion_of_the_Course*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"<em>Conclusion of the Course</em> by Your Guides","level":3,"id":"*Conclusion_of_the_Course*_by_Your_Guides_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/level-2-opening-the-heart.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3-emotional-balance-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474464,"modifiedTime":1759272585759,"sourceSize":4279,"sourcePath":"1.

We can't stop our thoughts any more than we can stop waves in the ocean. Resting the mind in its natural state is very different from trying to stop thoughts altogether.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nThe most effective meditation techniques for me are meditating with thoughts and emotions. Why? Because, when you meditate on, let us say the breath, sensations, or sound, there is still a problem with thoughts and emotions – \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada,\" the monkey mind. That can become an obstacle. Even though you already became friends with other things like form, sound, smell, taste, sensation, pain, and sleepiness, you do not know how to meditate with the monkey mind itself – the crazy thoughts and emotions.\nWhat is a thought? Normally, a thought has a lot of images and voices. For example with an apple: there is an image of an apple and you think, \"Oh, an apple! Should I eat the apple? I like apples! Is that a good or bad apple?\" There are a lot of voices. There are also sensations in your body. With thoughts, however, there are fewer sensations and more images and voices. And with emotions, there are normally a lot of sensations or feelings, especially in the body. That comes with emotions.\nNow, I will teach you thought meditation. Emotion meditation comes later.\nHow do you meditate with thoughts? It is very easy. Maybe you know, right? Do you know how to meditate with thoughts? It is very easy. What is the essence of meditation? The essence of meditation is awareness, right? Now, do you know how to meditate here? Just be aware of your thoughts. That is all! Thoughts are like these mala beads [Mingyur Rinpoche holds up his mala] – they come one after another, \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nRegarding \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada:\" Sometime in 2007, I was studying English in Vancouver, Canada. My English teacher said while he was writing on the whiteboard, \"Something like this, and yada, yada, yada. And this is like that, and yada, yada, yada.\" I thought, \"What is 'yada, yada, yada'?\" So I went back to my room and looked for \"yada, yada, yada\" in the dictionary, and I could not find it. The next day, I asked my teacher, \"What is the meaning of 'yada, yada, yada'?\" He said, \"Oh, that means 'blah, blah, blah'\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I thought that was a good example for the monkey mind – \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.\"\nThoughts are like these mala beads: they come one after the other, \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.\" Normally, it is like that.\nNow, when you meditate on thoughts, watch your thoughts, be aware of them, observe, and feel them. There are different flavors that will depend on your personality. For some of you, watching thoughts feels better, for others feeling the thoughts might be better, and some of you label the thoughts and feel a better connection.\nWhatever style you use to watch thoughts is fine. When you watch thoughts, it will become like this [Mingyur Rinpoche plays with the mala beads.] The thumb represents awareness – the watcher. There is still the \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada,\" continuously, but with the thumb (awareness.) Normally, it is without the thumb, it goes by itself, right? \"Blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.\" But now, it is with the thumb. That is the difference.\nAnyway, we will try this together. Please keep your meditation posture, and rest your mind as it is. You can keep your eyes closed or open, it does not matter.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please watch your thoughts.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, rest your mind as it is, again.\n[Silent meditation.]\nOkay. How was it?\nHow many of you have the experience that when you are watching thoughts, they disappear? They are gone, you cannot find them. If yes, raise your hand. This is kind of a big problem because, for thought meditation, we need thoughts. If you look for thoughts and they disappear, that is a big problem, right?\nNow, we will try again. This time, you have to create thoughts! They should be clear, many, and speedy. I will say, \"One, two, three! Create thoughts, and watch them.\" You have to watch all thoughts; do not lose a single thought without watching it, okay?\nNow, please keep your meditation posture, and get ready to watch thoughts.\nOne, two, three! Create thoughts and watch them.\n[Silent meditation.]\nOkay. How was it?\nI would like to share something with you – one of the biggest secrets. The secret is . . . Now, my heart is jumping, because this is a big secret and I am telling it to you [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] No problem. It is in my books, so do not worry. The secret is that when you look at thoughts, there are two possible experiences. Now it is finished. Did you understand? No? I will tell you more then.\nWhat are these two possible experiences? The first is that when you watch thoughts, they are already gone. You cannot see them. That is very good! It is one of the best meditation experiences. Why? Because your mind is back in open awareness. There is a gap for a few seconds. Normally, you have a lot of thoughts, right? And now you need them. So when you need thoughts and try to watch them, they are gone, they have gone quiet.\nThis experience is like waiting at the bus stop, but there is no bus coming. You are waiting and, finally, the bus is coming. You are so happy! But as soon as you try to enter the bus, the bus leaves. There is no bus. \"Huh...\" It is like that. That is very good! Stay with that gap. The gap is not very long, just a few seconds, before another thought pop up. You can watch it and then it is gone. That is very good. It is one of the best meditation experiences.\nThe second experience is that when you watch your thoughts, you can watch them. The thought does not disappear, it continues, \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada,\" and you can watch it. That is also very good! It is one of the best meditation experiences. Why? Because now thoughts have become the object of your meditation, they have become supports for your meditation.\nRemember, if you see the river, that means you are out of the river, right? But the river still flows. You do not have to block the river. The river still flows but you are watching. It is just like that. When you watch a thought, you and the thought are not the same – there is space. Space comes automatically. While thoughts come and go, you are watching them. It is like when you are \"watching\" sounds, visual objects, or your breath. It is the same thing. Now, thoughts have become your support.\nTherefore, normally, if you watch thoughts and you cannot see them, that is great! You do not have to create thoughts, okay? But, when you watch your thoughts, if you can see them, that is great, too! Then, do not try to make them disappear.\nThis experience is like watching television. It has a big 360° screen, and it is also 3D. This is what I call, \"inner television.\" If you feel bored, watch your inner television. If you can watch it, that is wonderful, right? It is very light. It will follow you wherever you go. You do not need to pay monthly bills. Thieves cannot steal your inner television. How nice! You just watch.\nBut, there is one problem. Should I tell you the problem? The problem is that the programs on the inner television are quite old. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Even if you change the channel, they are all running the same boring program, again and again – \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.\" This part is a little bit difficult. But it is okay. If you watch all the boring programs, again and again, the result will be different. The result will be that your mind becomes more calm, peaceful, pliable, and workable.\nTherefore, when you watch your thoughts, if you can see them, that is great! It is one of the best meditation experiences. If you cannot see them, great! It is also one of the best meditation experiences. Now, your meditation will become very easy. You just need to watch the thoughts.\nThat is all! 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n140 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice (Streak = consecutive days of practice)\nUse the practice instructions given by Mingyur Rinpoche and in the guided meditations\nTip\nEverytime you notice that you have been distracted, you are strengthening awareness. Celebrate those moments!\nMeditating with Thoughts\nBegin session Begin with finding a comfortable posture, keeping the spine upright and letting the mind and body be relaxed and at ease. Bring the mind and body together. Know the experience of sitting.&nbsp;\nBring a sense of meaning to your practice by setting an inspiring motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, to benefit not only myself, but also my friends, family, and society.\"&nbsp;\nThen rest your mind in open awareness for a few moments, simply letting everything be as it is. Main practice As you rest in open awareness, when thoughts arise, embrace them with a gentle touch of awareness.&nbsp;\nImages and/or words may appear in the mind. Simply let these come and go as they will. When one thought goes away, and before the next thought arises, just rest in open awareness.\nThere is no need to analyze, \"Is this a good or bad thought? What does this mean?\" etc. Simply know that you are watching thoughts.\nYou can periodically take a break from meditating with thoughts and go to what is easiest to connect with, then return to thoughts.\nRecognize how thoughts arise within awareness, stay, and then dissolve in awareness, similarly to clouds appearing, staying, and dissolving in the sky. End Session Finally, drop what you are doing and rest in open awareness for a few moments.\nEnd your session with a dedication, thinking, \"May this meditation benefit others, including my friends, family, and society.\" When you watch thoughts, are you able to watch them, or do they tend to disappear?Have you had both experiences—sometimes you can watch thoughts and sometimes they disappear? Is there any difference in how you experience awareness in these two situations?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.3.1 Transforming Thoughts Application\" data-href=\"1.3.1 Transforming Thoughts Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.1-transforming-thoughts-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.3.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Thoughts (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Thoughts_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Meditating with Thoughts</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Meditating_with_Thoughts*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.1-transforming-thoughts-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.1-transforming-thoughts-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474433,"modifiedTime":1759272585794,"sourceSize":11234,"sourcePath":"1.

The important thing is the relationship between you and monkey mind. If you treat your monkey mind as your boss or enemy, then there is a problem. The monkey mind is restless and crazy, and you do not want a crazy boss. Or, if you try to fight with monkey mind, then monkey mind becomes your enemy. And that enemy will always be there in your mind.\nOn the other hand, if you make friends with monkey mind, actually, monkey mind is quite good. The monkey mind is useful and, eventually, monkey mind transforms into wisdom, love, compassion, and awareness. Therefore, the relationship with monkey mind is really important.\nOne important thing in order to make friends with monkey mind is that you have to get to know each other well. That is very important.\nNow, I will tell you a little bit about how monkey mind causes problems. I do not want to use sensitive examples, at least not for now (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs), but I do want to use something simple that everybody cares about. Normally, I use the face or belly. I do not know if you prefer the face or belly. Do you like the face or belly? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Even if you raised your hand, I do not know, right? Let us see. I will use the face as an example.\nIn your life, if you have a big problem, then your monkey mind is very happy. The monkey mind has a job, and dwells on that problem again, and again, and again, making a small problem look like a big one. For example, if you meet a friend, and your friend is telling you about his or her problems, you may feel like, \"That it is not a big problem. You are okay.\" But, for your friend, it might seem like the end of the world. But for you, it is not a big problem. So, if you say \"It is okay. It is not a big problem\", your friend might think, \"You do not understand me\", right?\nThen you share your own problem with your friend, and your friend might laugh, and say \"What are you talking about? That is okay!\" But for you, it is a big problem. That is how the monkey mind makes small problems look like big problems.\nNow, whatever problem you have, that problem is gone—that episode is gone. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So, one episode is gone, and for a few days, even a few months, you have a holiday with no problems, and the monkey mind gets worried, \"I do not have a job! Soon I will become jobless and homeless. I have to do something\". So, one day you go to the bathroom and look at the mirror and, suddenly, you see something on your face, maybe new wrinkles, or the wrinkles were already there, but you did not recognize them before. Or maybe your right cheekbone is bigger than your left cheekbone, or your nose is crooked, or you have a pimple or something like that.\nAnd then your monkey mind says \"Oh dear! There is a problem with my face!\" like the cheekbone. Then you are a little bit worried, and after finishing using the bathroom, you come back and have breakfast, and while you are having breakfast, you are thinking about your cheekbone again, \"Oh, the cheekbone! Yes\".\nWhat happens is that our brain has neurons, what I call \"gossipy neurons\". They love to gossip and talk to each other: \"Oh, that cheekbone is ugly. That is an ugly face\". And then, more and more neurons come together, and they become a group, and the group becomes bigger and bigger.\nAfter that, after breakfast, you go to work, and if you are busy, you will forget about the cheekbone. But, after 5 p.m, when you have finished work, and you come back home and relax on the sofa, you think: \"Huh! the cheekbone.\" So you think about the cheekbone. \"Oh yeah, that cheekbone is a little bit ugly. Hmm, what should I do?\" Then you will think more and more, and you feel like you have become uglier. Maybe next week, when you look at the same mirror, you will feel that you have become much uglier than last week. But, actually, you are fine. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] But you feel that you are ugly. You feel like \"oh, everybody is looking at my cheekbone. She is looking at my cheekbone. He is looking at my cheekbone\".\nThen, when you go to work, you feel a little bit embarrassed, and then that has become like a circle. Sometimes you might think, \"Oh, not everybody is looking at my cheekbone, this is just my own perception\". And then you do some research, \"Hmm, are they all looking at my cheekbone or not?\" And the result is, \"Yes! They are all looking at my cheekbone.\" So you got the wrong result. Then, it has become a circle. So, this is not only with the cheekbone. It also appears in your relationship, at work between you and your colleagues, between you and your projects, between you and your goals, and between you and the world, society, and others. It manifests in many different ways, and that is how our monkey mind creates problems.\nHow can we work with the monkey mind? The key point is that if you try to fight it, it does not work. If you listen and believe, \"Yes, I am ugly. My cheekbones are terrible\", it does not work. What you have to do for the meditation practice is to free monkey mind in a very skillful way. What is the skillful way? The skillful way is making friends with monkey mind. How do we make friends with monkey mind? Giving a banana does not work! You need to give a job to monkey mind. If you give a job to monkey mind, then you become the boss, and monkey mind becomes your employee, and its job is all these different meditation techniques. And then, slowly, slowly, your mind becomes calmer and more peaceful. Not only calm and peaceful but also pliable and workable. Now, monkey mind becomes better, nicer, wiser, and kind. Then monkey mind becomes beneficial for you. The issue is the relationship between you and monkey mind. That is the issue, but monkey mind is neither bad nor good.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWhat is the best way to make friends with monkey mind?

We do not really look at it. We do not really know who it is or what it is. But it is not that we do not see it, or that it is completely outside of our noticing. It is not like that. It is there! It is like something in the corner of your eye that is always disturbing you.&nbsp;\nI will use an example of how to watch the monkey mind. Normally, there are two styles of the relationship between you and the monkey mind. The first is, \"Yes, sir!\" And the second is, \"Hey, get out!\"\nThe \"Yes, sir!\" is when the monkey mind comes and you listen to the monkey mind. \"Yes, sir! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" When the monkey mind goes here, you go here. And when the monkey mind goes here, you go here. When the monkey mind says, \"Go up!\" you go up. The monkey is crazy, so you become crazy. That is the first style: \"Yes, sir!\"\nThe second style is when you hate the monkey mind. You do not like thoughts, the voice in your head. You want to have quiet. You do not like to have these bad feelings or bad thoughts. What we do is like what I did with my panic: I tried to get rid of my panic. When the monkey mind came, I said, \"Oh, you! Be quiet! Shut up! Oh!\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] And then you are fighting. Then the monkey mind becomes louder and stronger, and then you have an enemy everywhere. That is the second style.\nIn the third style, in meditation, what you do is that when you meditate with thoughts, you say, \"Hello, monkey! How are you?\" And the monkey jumps here and there and you just watch. \"Blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada. Haha! Hoo hoo!\" You are just watching the monkey. [Mingyur Rinpoche waves.] That is the third style.\nIf you know the secret of how to make the monkey mind your friend – the third style – then you do not have to get rid of the monkey mind. Like when you see the river, you are out of the river, right? So the monkey mind becomes your friend. It does not become your boss; it does not become your enemy. How nice!\nLet's practice together. We are going to practice this meditation.\nPlease keep your meditation posture.\nFirst, rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please be aware of thoughts. If thoughts come – great! If you can see them – great! If, when you watch thoughts, they disappear, and you cannot see them – great! Do not make thoughts. Do not choose.\n[Silent meditation.]\nThe watcher&nbsp;is&nbsp;awareness. The watcher is watching whatever comes in your mind. It is watching. It does not matter if you see something or you do not see something. Both are good. Let it be completely natural.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, rest your mind as it is, again.\n[Silent meditation.]\nOkay. Now you have become friends with the monkey mind! 25 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nTip\nRecognize that there is no such thing as positive, negative, or neutral thoughts—thoughts are just thoughts.\nMeditating with Automatic Thoughts\nBegin session Begin by finding a comfortable posture. Next, rest in open awareness for a few moments. Imagine yourself slipping into a warm bath and completely relax and let go.\nSet your motivation, thinking, \"I am going to meditate, to benefit not only myself, but also my friends, family, and society.\" Main practice When thoughts arise, gently turn your attention to them. You do not have to change, stop, or slow them down; simply observe them as they arise in awareness, dwell in awareness, and dissolve in awareness.&nbsp;\nGet curious about your thoughts. What are they like? Do they mostly consist of words or sounds in your mind, or are there a lot of images? Step back and observe your mind, and notice what your thoughts are like right now.\nThe point is not to judge or evaluate your thoughts. Instead, you learn to see thoughts as clouds passing through the sky. It does not matter whether the clouds are nice, white, and fluffy, or dark and ominous storm clouds. Whatever your thoughts are like, just let them come and go while being aware of them.&nbsp;\nIt is perfectly normal to get distracted and caught up in your thoughts. When you notice this has happened, you are already back in awareness.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, drop all the mental doing, and just rest in open awareness for a few moments. Simply be present.&nbsp;\nNext, bring your attention to some specific thoughts. Bring to mind a situation in your life that you find enjoyable. What are the automatic thoughts linked to this situation? Take a moment to notice what your mind naturally does when you keep this situation in mind—just observe these thoughts.&nbsp;\nNow, do the same as above, but this time, bring to mind a little bit more challenging situation, maybe something that is frustrating.\nRecognize that it does not matter if your thoughts are positive, negative, or neutral—thoughts are just thoughts. Learn to treat them as neutral experiences and to observe them. End Session If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them and just rest in open awareness.\nEnd your session with a dedication that your meditation will benefit others. Do you recognize that thoughts are just thoughts? Does this change how you relate to your thoughts? If so, describe how.When doing this practice, is there any difference between observing thoughts linked to an enjoyable or frustrating situation? If so, describe how you experience this.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.3.2 It's Just a Thought Application\" data-href=\"1.3.2 It's Just a Thought Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.2-it's-just-a-thought-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.3.2 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditating with Thoughts (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Meditating_with_Thoughts_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Third Option</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_Third_Option*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.2-it's-just-a-thought-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.2-it's-just-a-thought-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474397,"modifiedTime":1759272585843,"sourceSize":6581,"sourcePath":"1.

We just drop them and are being completely natural. Then, even if expectations come, we just watch them. Expectations may come and go. It is just like watching a river. When you see the river, then you are out of the river, but the river still comes and goes, right?&nbsp;\nLet us practice together. First, please keep your meditation posture and relax.\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd then... How was it? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs]\nI think you might have had a lot of thoughts and curiosity. I said nothing, right? In the beginning, there is an expectation, \"Hmmm, now we are going to practice,\" and I said: \"Rela...\"\nIn everyday life, when we face these kinds of situations, we have to really remember our meditation, so we just observe the expectations. There are thoughts, feelings, and sensations in the body. Just let them come, and let them go.\nNow, you still might have those memories, or you might think: \"Maybe the video is wrong or stuck\", but I did it on purpose.\nRegarding awareness, although our mind is jumping, surprising, disappointing, curious, or whatever, all these are just like waves upon the ocean. The ocean has waves, right? The waves go up and down, up and down, and wherever the wave goes, the water goes. The water is awareness. The ocean is the water, and the waves cannot go beyond the water.\nAwareness is with us all the time. Just connect with awareness. You can connect with awareness by watching thoughts and emotions.\nThere is a traditional Indian story that once, one cowherd was looking after cows. He had been looking after cows his entire life and when he became sixty-something years old, he thought, \"Oh, this is a boring job. I have done this job for my entire life.\" Every day he did the same thing, and he felt like it had no meaning. He thought that he wanted to do something new so he looked for a meditation teacher.\nHe finally found a great meditation teacher and asked him to teach him meditation. The teacher taught him meditations on watching the breath, all these meditations. So, he stayed in a nearby cave and meditated on the breath. But, the problem was that he had a lot of thoughts. Cows came to his mind because his entire life was with the cows. Now, when he watched his breath, cows came, \"booh\". \"Booh\" is the sound of a Tibetan cow, in the West, maybe it is \"moo\". he loved the horns, and he tried to block the cow. \"No cow, no cow, please, breathing... Moo!\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs].\nIn the end, he thought, \"I have no connection with this meditation.\" He cried, and he went back to the teacher. He reported to the teacher, \"You taught me a wonderful meditation technique, but I think that I have no connection with this meditation. Because when I meditate, all I think about is cows, and these cows drive me crazy! The teacher told him, \"Oh, that is okay.\" He first laughed and said, \"No problem. There is a different meditation technique. I will teach it to you, it is called \"cow meditation\". And the cowherd was so curious. He asked, \"Is there a cow meditation?\" And the teacher said, \"Yes! For cow meditation, you need to watch the cows. So, when you think about cows, it is okay. The cows are in the barn, and you are sending them into the field, and now they are eating grass. You watch that and when they have finished, you send them back to the barn.\" or something like that.\nHe was so happy! He went back to the cave and watched cows, and when the cows came, he could watch them. Now, all the thoughts of cows became support for his meditation. They did not become his enemy or boss, they became his friend, the object of meditation. His mind became calmer, more peaceful, and so happy.\nThen he went back to the teacher and thanked him. \"This cow meditation is really good! is there a second level of this cow meditation?\" The teacher said, \"Yes, the second level of cow meditation is that you have to think of yourself as a cow.\" And the cowherd was very happy. He went back to the cave thinking, \"I am a cow, I have this long mouth, horns, and sometimes I say 'Moo'.\" So his mind became clearer and calmer and he was so happy.\nHe went back to the teacher and asked, \"Is there a third level of cow meditation?\" and the teacher said, \"Yes, the third level is that you need to focus on one aspect of your body that is clearest for you\". And the cowherd focused on the horns because he liked the horns. So, he went back to the cave thinking, \"I am a cow. I have horns\". Then, in the end, the horns became so vivid and clear and, at the same time, his mind became very calm, peaceful, joyful, clear, and without concepts. And not only that, but his mind also became pliable and workable. Whatever he thought about, he could think clearly and did not worry about a thing. He became the master of the monkey mind.\nTherefore, you can do the same. Maybe if you think about your smartphone [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] or a to-do list where you list all the things in your life, or whatever, you just watch, and they become your friend, the object of your meditation.\nIn our lives, normally we expect a lot. We have very strong expectations, and expectations create fear and resistance. Expectations and fear are like an accelerator and brake. This causes what we call \"suffering\", a lot of problems in our life. Now, if you make friends with them, they will be liberated. Your mind will be free from those things. Your mind will become calm, peaceful, pliable, and workable.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that expectations create fear. How is this so? Question 2\nHow is it that thoughts become your friends when you simply watch them? Points to remember:\nThoughts are like the waves upon the ocean (awareness), and the waves are not different from the ocean.\nWhen you simply watch your thoughts, they can become your friends.\nExpectations create fear, and these two lead to a lot of suffering.\nIf you make friends with expectations and fear, they are liberated and your mind becomes more calm, peaceful, pliable, and workable.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nhow to work with monkey mind itself\nthe two possibilities that can occur when you observe thoughts\nthe role of awareness in working with thoughts The Joy of Living, pp. 161–166&nbsp;Ch. 12, \"Using Your Thoughts\"\nTip\nLet obsessive thoughts themselves become the reminder for meditation.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.3.2 It's Just a Thought Meditation\" data-href=\"1.3.2 It's Just a Thought Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.2-it's-just-a-thought-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.3.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on It's Just a Thought (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_It's_Just_a_Thought_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Cow Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Cow_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.2-it's-just-a-thought-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.2-it's-just-a-thought-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474389,"modifiedTime":1759272585862,"sourceSize":7388,"sourcePath":"1.

Emotions have a lot of bodily sensations. There are a lot of things, like temperature, pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings, or a tight sensation. Sometimes there are headaches, sometimes relief, sometimes it is pleasant, sometimes unpleasant — there are so many different sensations. As soon as you see something you like, there is a pleasant sensation in your body. If you do not like it, there is an unpleasant sensation in your body.&nbsp;\nWhen I was young, I had these panic attacks. With the panic came a lot of unpleasant sensations. My heart was beating faster, and I felt tight around the throat, things like that. Then my father taught me emotion meditation. Emotion meditation has been really beneficial for me.\nHow do we practice this emotion meditation? Actually, it is very easy. Although we are learning many different meditation techniques, it is actually just one, right? It is awareness. Just be aware of the emotion. That becomes emotion meditation.\nNow, we are going to practice this together. Please keep your meditation posture, and first rest your mind as it is.\n(Silent meditation.)\nNow, please watch your emotions. Emotions have a lot of bodily sensations. Of course, there are images and sounds, but mostly, there are sensations in your body. Just be aware of them. Watching emotions is just like watching thoughts or listening to sounds. It does not matter which emotion arises — anger, hatred, desire, or anxiety. Do not try to control it. Just allow emotions to come, be in awareness, and allow them to dissolve.\n(Silent meditation.)\nNow rest your mind as it is, again.\n(Silent meditation.)\nOkay. That is all. It is very simple. How was it?\nYou do not have to do anything particular. There is no need to control, no need to create a good emotion, no need to stop a bad emotion. You are just watching.\nAwareness is more than an emotion, more than a thought. Awareness is like the sky; it accommodates clouds, different weathers, all of these things, right? It lets them come, lets them be, lets them dissolve. You can do the same thing. All these sensations and feelings are just like clouds. Sometimes there is a beautiful cloud, sometimes an ugly cloud, sometimes a storm with lightning, or a tornado, or a hurricane. It is okay. The sky is still free. They cannot change the nature of the sky, right? When the sky becomes completely blue with the sun shining, the nature of the sky does not change. Even though the sky becomes completely dark — there is no sun, no moon, it is completely covered by clouds — the essence of the sky cannot be changed by these clouds, this darkness. The sky is always free. It is always there. It is pure and genuine. Your awareness is just like that. But, normally we do not recognize awareness, and we are lost in thoughts, feelings, emotions, and sensations like we are lost in the clouds.\nWhen we watch the sensations, when we watch the emotions, then automatically, our awareness becomes bigger than the emotions, bigger than the sensations. There is space. When you see the river, you are out of the river, right? But you do not have to create that space. Space comes automatically if you watch the emotions — as a byproduct of watching. This is important. Many people say, \"Oh, I have to create some distance. I have to make space. Where is space? I cannot see the space.\" There is no need to do this. Just watch. If you cannot see the emotion, if, when you look at the emotion, the emotion disappears — great! There is a gap. This is open awareness. Be with the gap. Either case is okay.\nTherefore, now you have already made friends with emotions. This is very good! But, of course, you cannot make friends with strong emotions, big emotions, in the beginning. You cannot do that. You have to start with a small emotion first.\nWhen I was young, my major emotion was panic. I could not watch my panic in the beginning. I felt it was too much. It overwhelmed me. So, I created anger. Anger is different from panic. I created anger and watched anger instead, and I felt, \"Mmm, I can do this.\" Then slowly, slowly, I could watch the panic. 25 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nTip\nIf an emotion is too strong to work with, try to shift your awareness to what triggers the emotion, and use that as the support for your practice.\nMeditating with Emotions\nBegin session Begin by finding a comfortable posture. Bring the body and mind together and rest in the awareness of sitting.\nSet the motivation that your meditation will be of benefit to others.\nLet everything be as it is, and rest in open awareness for a few moments. Main practice As you rest in open awareness, notice whether there is any emotion present. If a very strong emotion is present, it can be helpful to work with something a little more manageable in the beginning.\nThere may be thoughts, images, and/or words occurring. See how these bring about any sensations in your body.&nbsp;\nThere is no need to analyze or try to figure out why you are feeling the way you do; simply know what you are experiencing.\nYou may notice that the emotions come and go. When a new emotion arises, just be with that one, embracing it with a gentle touch of awareness.\nLet everything be within awareness.\nFrom time to time, drop what you are doing and just rest in open awareness for a few moments.&nbsp;\nIf you are getting caught up in the story of the emotion, as soon as you notice this, you are back in awareness.&nbsp;\nEach emotion will have its own flavor; simply be aware of whatever is arising. There is no need to hold on or analyze. Just let be.&nbsp;\nNext, let go of any focus and rest in open awareness, leaving everything as it is.&nbsp; End Session End by dedicating the session, wishing that this practice will bring peace and happiness not only to your own life, but also to the lives of others.

It goes up and down, up and down. Actually, when the stock market goes up and down, then you make money, right? If the stock market does not go up and down, if it is always flat, then there is no business. You cannot make money. It is similar in our life. There is a lot of ups and downs. Because life has ups and downs, it is colorful and dramatic. There are a lot of adventures. Normally, we learn or grow the most when we are facing down experiences.&nbsp;\nMy father used to tell me that when you are going somewhere and the road ends – when you reach a dead-end – what you have to do first is to take off your backpack and throw it over the wall. Once your backpack is on the other side, you have to cross over the wall, right? Then you will use your capabilities, skills, and wisdom. You try your best and, actually, you have a lot of things there, within you. We all have great qualities within us. We all have awareness, love, compassion, wisdom, capabilities, and skills. All of them are there, but most of the time they are sleeping. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You do not know they are there. When you face difficult situations, then they wake up.\nTherefore, difficult emotions, situations, problems, and obstacles in your life, whatever comes, if you use them as support for your meditation, that is really beneficial. Especially now that we are practicing emotion meditation. For me, my emotions really helped my panic.\nMaybe because of panic, I am here today teaching. It changed my life. I have always considered panic my friend and also as my teacher. But, in the beginning, it was not so easy. Even though it is not so easy, if you meditate a little bit, there are a lot of benefits. In the end, if you cannot meditate, it is okay. Then try again. To meditate with difficult emotions, even though it is very difficult, it is not so easy, but it has a lot of benefits. You can develop your meditation a lot.\nThe important thing is that it is not about experiences; it is about trying and intention. If you want to meditate with a difficult emotion, like panic, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, or whatever has become a problem for you, you can watch all of them, and they become supports for meditation. But, in the beginning, you will fail. Do not be afraid, do not care about failing. Failure is the mother of success. Try again and again.\nThe most important thing if you want to meditate with this difficult emotion, is that at the moment you try to meditate, awareness is right there. You might not have the taste of meditation. Normally, the taste of meditation comes with an \"up\" experience, like peace, clarity, non-conceptuality, those experiences that make you feel like, \"I am doing it right! Now I am in meditation.\" When the strong emotion comes, those experiences are not there – there is no taste. Even though there is no taste, you are trying and trying, so awareness is there.\nSo, what is important for us? That we have to believe that the moment we try to meditate – awareness is there – we are doing it right. This is something we call, \"zero meditation.\" Zero means that you do not feel like you are meditating. You feel like, \"Hmm, this is not working. Am I doing it right or wrong? Where is awareness? I do not feel calm.\" But you are trying. The moment you are trying to practice, awareness is there. Awareness is the essence of meditation, not peace, calm, or all these things.\nZero meditation is really of benefit to me, and I think it will be of benefit to you, too. Eventually, all emotions can become your friends and support for your meditation.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that meditation develops the most in difficult circumstances. Why is this? Question 2\nHow would you explain \"zero meditation\" to a friend? Points to remember:\nWe grow the most in challenging situations\nMeditative experience is not important.

For me, when I am not watching my emotions, the emotions become so solid and big, they are like big rocks rolling over me. So, this is very very difficult. But, when I watch the emotions, then they become pieces; there are images, voices, and lots of sensations. The sensations are changing, like the waves of the ocean – they curve – and you cannot really find their exact location. There are temperature and heartbeats. They become like pieces. I call this, \"emotions being like shaving foam.\" When you apply shaving foam, it looks like a piece of white rock here, [Mingyur Rinpoche points to his face] but inside it is full of bubbles. This has really benefited me.&nbsp;\nWe will practice this together now. The important thing, of course, is that we have to start with a small emotion, not very strong, something that is doable. If you have a major emotion, create another emotion; like when I was young, I could not watch my panic directly, so I created anger, and I watched the anger. We have to do this.\nNormally, we say that there are four steps in emotion meditation. The first one is \"watch\" or \"be aware\" of the emotion. The second is \"change\" or \"try something different\" – change the focus. The third is to \"step back,\" and the last one is to \"take a break.\" These are the four steps.\nThe first one, watching the emotion, is just like watching your breath or sounds. Watch the emotion, and then you can see the different pieces – audio, video, and sensations in the body. Sometimes when you watch an emotion, especially when you have a strong emotion within you, you may feel overwhelmed. Then, you have to change the method. Try something different. Change the focus – listen to sound if you feel overwhelmed, or watch your breath, or focus on a visual object, or rest in open awareness. So you need to change the method. Then, after some time, you can come back again or make another emotion. For example, I made anger and watched the anger – this is also trying something different.\nFor the third one, sometimes even if you try something different, it does not work. Why? Because we have this emotion of emotion. When I was young and had panic attacks, I had the panic of panic, fear of panic, aversion of panic. So this fear, aversion, or resistance to panic stay behind the panic, and they are supporting the panic. These are kind of boosters of the panic.\nAnd then, there are expectations – you want to be free, calm, and peaceful. Expectations and aversion are like the accelerator and brake, and with these, you can drive a car. So the cause, trigger, or support of panic is aversion – the panic of panic – and expectations. These two make panic continuously going.\nNow, to step back means to not look at the panic, but instead, look behind the panic at the motivation, expectations, aversion, fear, resistance, not liking the panic, look at those emotions. This is really helpful – to step back.\nThen, on some days, even when you do that you feel tired or exhausted, then take a break. You know how to take a break, right? I do not need to teach you. So, how do you take a break? You sleep, go for a walk, exercise, eat something, read a book, or something like that. You have to take a break sometimes.\nNow, we are going to practice together.\nFirst, please keep your meditation posture, and if you want to have your eyes closed or open is up to you.\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please watch the emotion. For some people, when they watch emotions, they become stronger or overwhelming. Then, try something different. Change the focus, like listening to sounds. You can listen to any sound.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, go back to the emotion again. If again, the emotion becomes bigger and stronger, then maybe you do not like the emotion. There is this feeling of aversion, resistance, fear of emotion, or disliking the feeling. Then, step back now. Do not watch your main emotion, look behind the emotion – at the expectations. They also become supports for your meditation.\n[Silent meditation.]\nSometimes, when you continue practicing or meditating and you feel tired or exhausted again, take a break.\nYeah, let us take a break! We are finished! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nThese four steps are really important. Normally, people just stick with the first one. They watch their emotions, get overwhelmed, and do not know what to do. Then, when they try to watch again, they have a lot of fear of their emotions. \"Oh, I am watching my emotions so they should dissolve, but why are they not dissolving?\"\nWhen I was young, I experienced this a lot. But my father said, \"Do not fight the emotions, make friends with them.\" I said, \"Oh, yes! Welcome emotions.\" It helped, but my motivation was, \"Hello panic. Welcome! If I say 'welcome,' then you will not come back again, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] The resistance and expectations came back again. But if I watched those, that helped.\nThese are the four steps of how to practice with emotion meditation. 25 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nTip\nWhen you find that your meditation does not work, remember to try the four steps.\nMeditating with Feelings and Emotions\nBegin session Take a moment to check in with your posture, finding a comfortable position that works for you.\nSet the motivation that your meditation will benefit others.\nThen, take a few deep breaths, noticing the feelings in your body as you breathe in and out.\nAllow yourself to breathe normally again and just rest in open awareness, leaving everything as it is. Main practice As you rest in open awareness, bring your attention to how you feel right now. How do you label this emotion or feeling?&nbsp;\nNow, drop the label, and see what it points to. What feelings and thoughts underlie this label?&nbsp;\nHowever you may feel, see whether you can observe your experience, not thinking about it, but simply examining it and seeing what it is that makes you feel this way.&nbsp;\nNext, see whether you can notice the subtle texture of this experience without trying to change it. The point here is not to change any feelings. Rather, it is to learn to change the way you relate to your experiences—to accept them, to let them be present without getting lost in the flow of the emotions.\nFrom time to time, drop what you are doing and just rest in open awareness for a few moments.\nOnce again, observe whatever emotions are present. Just examine this experience, seeing what it is really like.&nbsp;\nDistractions are not the enemy of meditation; they are a natural part of practice. Every time your mind wanders, see whether you can notice that and pick up where you left off.\nNext, rest your awareness in your body. What sensations in your body underlie the label you give the emotion or feeling? If you feel stressed, where do you feel that in your body and how does it feel? Explore and see what you find.&nbsp;\nNow, observe what is happening in your mind. Are there any particular thoughts, judgments, memories, or anything else happening that is associated with this emotion? Whatever is happening, just observe it as it comes and goes.&nbsp;\nOnce again, observe what emotions are present. Notice how you have a very strong tendency to like certain experiences and dislike others. These emotions and impulses of liking and disliking are not good or bad. Simply treat them as passing experiences while being aware of them. End Session Now, let go of what you are doing and just rest in open awareness, letting the mind be completely natural.\nEnd your session by dedicating it to benefit yourself and others. Is there any of the four steps that you find particularly helpful right now? If so, explain which one it is and why it is beneficial.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

Rather, it depends on the relationship between you and the emotion. If you know how to work with emotions, they are really good and beneficial, and they transform into wisdom. They transform into love and compassion. They transform into awareness.\nWe all have this basic, innate goodness. This basic goodness contains the great qualities that are within all of us. No matter who you are, your true nature is great, awesome, wonderful! But normally, we do not know that. Let's say we have ten qualities within us – one negative and nine positive. Normally, we see only the negative one, and we exaggerate that and do not see the nine good qualities within us. Actually, you, I, everybody, we all have all these great qualities. The problem is that the monkey mind makes a mountain out of a molehill. It makes small problems into huge problems. Therefore, meditation teachings and the practice really helps us to connect with our basic goodness.\nIn these courses, we are trying to connect with awareness. Awareness is always there, no matter who you are. Awareness is pure, free, and genuine. It is wonderful, right? It is awesome! We have this awareness all the time but, normally, we do not know that. Now you know, because you are learning, and you are learning this meditation practice. So you recognize it, right? In the beginning, I introduced awareness. Normally, I ask, \"Do you recognize awareness? Or do you not? Or is it maybe?\" For all three, I say, \"Good. You all recognize awareness.\" Why? When you think you do not recognize awareness, actually, you know that you do not know. That is why you say, \"Oh, I do not recognize it,\" right? Awareness is right there. \"I do not know awareness.\" If you know that, that is awareness. If you are confused, \"I do not know. Maybe I know awareness, maybe I do not know awareness.\" That is also awareness because you know that you are confused. You are aware that you are confused.\nAwareness does not get stuck with knowing, not knowing, or being confused. Awareness does not only stick with clarity, joy, and peace. Awareness is there with the dullness, confusion, pain – it is everywhere. The problem is that we do not recognize awareness. That is the problem. There is no problem whether we have awareness or not. Awareness is part of basic goodness. But that is not all. All the other qualities like love, compassion, wisdom, skills, capabilities, power, etc. – we all have those. Eventually, through these courses, I hope you will explore this more and more, and you will have a better understanding.\nWhat I would particularly like to focus on now is emotions, and how these meditation practices transform emotions. For example, if you watch anger or hatred, you do not have to block hatred, and you do not have to follow or create hatred. Just by watching, it breaks into pieces, it changes, and there is space. You are not the hatred. Eventually, what happens is that the bad quality of hatred goes away. The bad quality of anger goes away. Then, the good qualities of anger, like energy and clarity – especially with anger, there is a lot of clarity or vividness – all remain. Why? Because all of these: clarity, energy, love, and compassion are all connected with our true nature. All the confusion and tightness – all these are based on a misconception, like the fixed mind. None of these are connected with our true nature. They will go away.\nIt is the same with all the other emotions, like, for example, desire. If you are feeling desire, watch the desire, and then, eventually, it transforms into wisdom. Desire has a particular quality of seeing things distinctly: \"Yes. Nice. Need. No need. So things become clearer and there is discernment, sometimes this is what we call the \"wisdom of discernment.\" If you watch pride, it normally thinks, \"I am best! They know nothing.\" It is unbalanced. This, eventually, dissolves, and then there is equanimity. At the same time, you have confidence. With ignorance, if you watch the feeling of dullness, of not knowing, of drowsiness, then it becomes nonconceptual, eventually. Clarity is the basis, but on the surface there is ignorance. But eventually, it becomes liberated into wisdom. With jealousy, when you watch jealousy, there is a need for achievement. There is a driving force there. The capacity for achievement is there, but the negative aspect of competing and destroying others, thinking, \"I have to win!\" – these things will go away.\nAll this comes by just watching. When you watch, you are connected with awareness. Awareness is like light – sunlight. When the sunlight is present, darkness will be automatically illuminated, right? Just like that.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that awareness is always present. Explain how this is possible. Question 2\nHow would you explain to a friend, in your own words, that emotions can be transformed into wisdom? Points to remember:\nEmotions are neither good or bad; it is all about how you relate to them.\nWe tend to see only the negative aspects of ourselves and fail to see the positive aspects.\nThe issue is not whether you have awareness, the matter is whether you recognize it.\nBasic goodness refers to the inherent qualities within all of us.\nThe five main negative emotions each have their own unique wisdom aspect.\nIn this reading, you will learn how to work with emotions more deeply.\nJoyful Wisdom, pp. 163–167&nbsp;Ch. 7, \"Step Six: Attending to Emotions\"\nTip\nIf you know that you do not know, that is awareness!\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.3.4 Transforming Emotions Meditation\" data-href=\"1.3.4 Transforming Emotions Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.4-transforming-emotions-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.3.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Transforming Emotions (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Transforming_Emotions_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Five Wisdoms</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_Five_Wisdoms*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.4-transforming-emotions-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.4-transforming-emotions-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474317,"modifiedTime":1759272585957,"sourceSize":6348,"sourcePath":"1.

For example, it could be while walking or commuting to work, doing the dishes, etc. Simply observe the pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sensations you experience in your body during this time.

Until now, you have all joined these courses, but the people that host this course gave me a message. They said that you all are not really sincerely attending and practicing. So I feel a little bit disappointed. I hope that in the future you all will try your best to do more practice, but at this moment I am kind of disappointed. I did not want to share this with you, but finally, I thought I would tell you.\nOkay. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] How do you feel? Do you feel sad? \"What?!\" Now you might have that emotion, you know? When you heard that I was quite disappointed, at that moment, what happens is that you are like, \"What? Who?\" Suddenly the sensations in your body change. You feel a little bit tight around your heart and in the stomach. An unpleasant sensation goes all over your body. That is an emotion. Emotions have sensations, so you have to watch that.\nActually, I am sorry that I told you that. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] I am going to tell you the truth. Do you want to know the truth? The truth is that they told me you are all doing very well. All those who are watching this video, I know all of you are watching very well. You have great intentions. You want to help—help yourself and others. It is a manifestation of kindness and compassion, isn't? Right? Otherwise, you would not watch this video. So I am so happy. Thank you![Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] What do you feel now? Now you might feel [Mingyur Rinpoche smiles and relaxes] \"Mmmm, yes.\" You have pleasant sensations in your body. The pleasant sensations go through your heart and all over your body. Watch that. That is an emotion. Although we practice emotion meditation, sometimes we do not feel any emotion, but there are subtle emotions there, always... Sorry. By the way, this was just an example, okay? It is not true. It is not based on the truth. Nobody reported anything to me. I just wanted to make you feel an emotion, that is why I told you those two things.\nNormally, we always have subtle emotions. It is really important to watch these emotions, because emotions have a lot of sensations in our body. So when you watch sensations, then awareness really goes deep into your heart, body, and muscles — into your entire existence, into your entire mind and body. This sensation, which is especially connected with the body, is playing a big role in our life.\nFor example, if you have an addiction to smoking, actually you are addicted to the sensation. But our mind is normally not aware of that. We project the smoking and then crave it, and this emotion becomes stronger and stronger. But if you watch the sensation in your body, then it will not become like a piece of rock—solid, strong, single, and permanent. Not like that. It becomes like pieces, it is changing, and you cannot really find it in one location.\nTherefore, it is really important to watch sensations. These sensations are the link between the mind and the outer world. The mind cannot directly connect with the outer world, the mind mostly connects with the outer world through these sensations. So pleasant sensations, combined together with whatever you see, translate to the mind as, \"Oh, that is good.\" And if whatever you see is more connected with unpleasant sensations, then the mind thinks, \"Oh, this is not good.\" So one of the most important conjunctions between the outer world and the mind is the sensation in the body.\nNow we are going to practice together.\nKeep your meditation posture, relax your body, and rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please watch whatever sensation that is in your body. Maybe there is a subtle sensation. Wanting to find this sensation also has sensation. It is subtle. If you cannot find this sensation, then there is an unpleasant sensation there. Or if you are confused, \"I cannot find any sensation. I want to find a sensation.\" That also has sensations. That will create a sensation in your body. Be aware of that.\n[Silent meditation.]\nOkay. Now rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nHmm. Okay!\nNext time when you go to work or outside anywhere, try to watch your sensations. As soon as you see something nice there is a pleasant sensation. If it is not nice, there is an unpleasant sensation. Normally, when we see something, we decide suddenly if we like it or not. Some sensations manifest in your body. So connect with your body and be aware of that.\nThat will really be of benefit. It has been of benefit to me and I hope it will be of benefit to you. 25 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nInquiry\nWhen being aware of bodily sensation, do you differentiate between pleasant and unpleasant sensations?\nMeditating with Subtle Emotions\nBegin session Begin by finding a comfortable meditation posture. Allow the mind and body to come together and simply know that you are sitting.\nSet the motivation that your meditation will benefit others.\nNext, simply rest in open awareness, letting everything be as it is. All the sense doors are open, yet we are not following any component of experience. Main practice As you rest in open awareness, try to become aware of any subtle emotions that are present by bringing your attention to the sensations in your body. These can often be a bridge between the outer and inner worlds. Is there any craving, wanting, aversion, laziness, or something else present? How is this reflected in the body? Simply be aware of whatever you are experiencing.\nThere may be times when you do not experience any subtle emotions. At these times, just notice any impact from your environment and how your mind responds.\nAllow whatever you are experiencing to simply arise within awareness, letting awareness accommodate whatever occurs in your mind.\nFrom time to time, drop what you are doing and just rest in open awareness.\nBring interest and curiosity to the subtle emotions that you are experiencing. You do not have to change what you are experiencing; just be aware of whatever takes place. End Session If your eyes have been closed, slowly open your eyes and just let everything be as it is, resting your mind in open awareness for a few moments.\nEnd your practice with dedicating any benefits of your meditation to the well-being and happiness of yourself and others. Do you experience a difference in practicing with subtle emotions as compared to emotions that are more overt?

I was around seven, eight years old. I do not know exactly what were the real causes of my panic, but I had a fear of snowstorms. In my hometown, we have a lot of snowstorms in the winter. One time, there was a big storm, and the whole house was shaking a little bit; there was the wind, snow, and there was a lot of noise, \"woooooo,\" something like that. I was holding the pillar in the middle of the house, and pushing in the opposite direction of the wind. My mom asked me, \"What are you doing?\" I said, \"Okay, there is this wind!\" Mom was laughing. And in the summer we had thunderstorms, the lightning and the thunder were very strong. Sometimes, I would come down to the Kathmandu Valley from my hometown, and I was really afraid of the cars and buses. We would be on the bus and with each bump, my heart was bumping. And the sound of fireworks cracking was a nightmare. I tried so many ways to deal with my panic: running up, down, playing, escaping into the caves, so many things that did not work.&nbsp;\nThen when I was nine, I began learning meditation from my father. My father said:\n\"Don't look for solutions outside. Real happiness is within. You need to find it inside and learn how to work with your mind.\"\nI began to learn meditation, and I loved the idea of meditation but I did not like the practice of meditation — I was a lazy boy. Then when I meditated, I would feel good, but afterward, I would forget about meditation and the panic would come back. When strong panic came back I would try to meditate, and my main motivation was, \"I want to get rid of this panic!\" that was my focus. I tried to connect with awareness and think, \"Hey panic! Get out! I am practicing meditation now.\" But that did not work. Sometimes the panic would get stronger and overwhelming.\nThen I asked my father about this problem that when I meditated with panic, panic would become stronger. My father said:\n\"Don't try to block your panic. Don't try to get rid of your panic. You have to make friends with your panic. Welcome your panic.\"\nThen he taught me more meditation techniques on how to welcome and use panic as a support for meditation. Then I practiced them. I would say, \"Hello panic, welcome.\" when the panic came and it went better. It went better than when I would try to stop or block the panic.\nAfter sometime later, still, the basic motivation was the same; I still wanted to get rid of my panic. So my welcome to the panic became like this, when the panic came I would say, \"Hello panic, welcome! If I say 'welcome' then you will not come back again, right?\" So it was basically the same motivation.\nWhen I was thirteen years old, I was in India at a place called \"Sherab Ling Monastery\" which is the main seat and center for one of my most important teachers, Vajradhara Tai Situ Rinpoche. I really wanted to go to retreat there because a traditional three-year retreat was going to start at the Sherab Ling Monastery. But I was a little bit afraid, \"Oh, maybe I am too young. I will not be accepted\". So I asked my father who wrote a letter to Tai Situ Rinpoche who kindly accepted me. I was so happy! So, I went into the three-year retreat hoping that my laziness would not come along? I was thinking, \"Wow! This is great! In this three-year retreat, there is a structure, and they have everybody practicing together. It will be so nice!\" The first month was very good, and then, the second month, the laziness slowly came back. Then after that, the laziness almost became the same as before, although I was doing structured sessions, my mind was all over the place. Then my panic came back and became worse because my laziness and panic got together and became good friends. Then I felt bad about that, and the panic became stronger.\nEvery day we had group practice together in the hall and sometimes we had traditional ritual practice and used a lot of musical instruments, like big horns and drums. I felt tightness in my neck, could not breathe, felt dizzy, and I would have to leave in the middle of the prayers. I was thinking, \"Okay, I still have two more years to go, what should I do? Should I spend two more years like this being unhappy, or should I really welcome my panic?\" So I decided to let go of trying to get rid of my panic, of the idea that I wanted to block, get rid of, and fighting it — I let go of that. I decided:\n\"Okay! From now on, I will really learn how to live with my panic and to use the panic as support for my meditation and awareness.\"\nThen I really welcomed my panic. Then the panic was in awareness, almost as if there was panic on the surface level, but beneath there was awareness holding it. The panic was accommodated by awareness. It came and went, and sometime later, I still had this sensation, the symptoms, but my mind was quite excited. Normally, I would feel panic of panic, resistance, and fear of panic, but now, all these were gone. The symptoms of panic were still there, but I felt quite excited, \"Aha! Okay! Panic... Hmm... I am observing, watching my heart beat faster. There is tightness here. I have a headache. I feel dizzy and cannot breathe.\" All these sensations were there, but my mind was quite excited to observe all this. Eventually, I and my panic became very good friends. Then I quite liked it. When the panic came, I did not feel bad anymore, it was kind of like an exciting feeling.\nThen, a few weeks later, I and my panic became very good friends, and I really felt that panic had become like my teacher and a friend. But then something bad happened. It was not a happy ending. Should I tell you about the not so happy ending? Okay, I will tell you. The not so happy ending was when my panic and I became very good friends, my panic did not have a good heart. My panic said, \"Bye, bye\" and it was gone. I missed my friend and teacher.\nActually, life has a lot of problems, so even though I missed one friend, there were many other friends. Problems are international, obstacles are international, right? So, I tried to make friends with other problems.\nThis practice was really beneficial to me. My panic was one of my best teachers and friends. In fact, panic changed my life. It transformed my life. This meditation practice is really good! It is like my father said — the real happiness is within. Once you know how to work with your mind, then you will find that, actually, the mind has a lot of great qualities like awareness, love, compassion, and wisdom — all these are there, but normally we do not recognize them.\nTherefore I hope these meditation techniques, as much as they have benefited me, will benefit you, too. You can apply these meditation techniques to any other problem. Life is full of problems, right? Problems are international, so although you may not have anxiety or panic, you might have depression, low self-esteem, phobias, cannot sleep well sometimes, there are a lot of worries sometimes, and especially nowadays there is a lot of stress. We may have stress caused by our work, deadlines, relationships, or social connections. We can use these techniques with any problem. Of course, in the beginning, it is quite difficult. We have the tendency of trying to get rid of all these problems. That is normal, and it is okay! Just accept it.\nFailure is the mother of success, and eventually, it will be really beneficial for you.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that he lost his best friend (panic). What do you think he means by this? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche's father told him to not seek happiness from outside circumstances but to look for it within. How would you explain this to a curious friend or colleague? In this reading, you will learn about Mingyur Rinpoche's own story of experiencing panic attacks and the advice he received from his teachers.\nJoyful Wisdom, pp. 27–32&nbsp;Ch. 1, \"Breakthrough\"\nInquiry\nWhen being aware of bodily sensation, do you differentiate between pleasant and unpleasant sensations?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.3.5 Everything Is Your Friend Meditation\" data-href=\"1.3.5 Everything Is Your Friend Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.5-everything-is-your-friend-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.3.5 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching on Everything Is Your Friend (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_on_Everything_Is_Your_Friend_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Panic Story</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_Panic_Story*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.5-everything-is-your-friend-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.5-everything-is-your-friend-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474289,"modifiedTime":1759272586006,"sourceSize":8848,"sourcePath":"1.

Realization — the stable awareness of the true nature of your mind — is like the sky itself, an unchanging background against which shifting experiences occur.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, I would like to teach you a very special meditation technique that we call, \"river-like meditation\" or sometimes \"choiceless meditation,\" or \"choiceless awareness\" — they have the same meaning. With this practice, you can mix any meditation techniques you have learned in the past — mix them all together.&nbsp;\nWhen I went to the mountains, I wanted to cook something. I never learned how to cook. So, I put together whatever was available there and made soup. It had very good taste. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Now, you can do the same thing.\nHow to mix them? The essence of meditation is awareness. There is only one essence, right? But the objects are different: forms, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, pain, sleepiness, and then thoughts and emotions. Then, there is meditation with no object — to just be with awareness itself —&nbsp;open awareness&nbsp;meditation. There are many different meditation techniques, including the breath and whatever else.\nHowever, the essence is one, so it does not matter which meditation technique you use or which object appears to you. Just be aware of it. If a form comes, and the visual object is more salient and vivid for you, you can just be aware of it. And suddenly, a sound comes. Maybe a truck or car is passing through nearby, \"Oh, listen to the sound.\" And then, in between, there is nothing, like there has just become a gap in your mind. That is&nbsp;open awareness.&nbsp;Be with nothing. Or then you get itchy. Be aware of the itchiness. That becomes sensation meditation. So, it could be anything. Maybe nothing is there, or sometimes when you open all the senses, and you are ready to be aware of anything, then your mind goes beyond concept, like \"Huh\". Like that. Just be with that.\nThere are no rules and no boundaries. Whatever comes in your mind, you are watching it. This is what we sometimes call \"river-like meditation.\" The river comes from the mountain, from somewhere above, and then comes down to the valley, over another mountain, through another valley, city, or town. It is changing all the time, right? Although it has changed location, it is the same continuation that goes to different places. Awareness continues, but the objects change.\nOr sometimes, we practice what we call \"choiceless meditation,\" because you are not choosing whatever comes. You are not particularly choosing&nbsp;open awareness&nbsp;or&nbsp;sound meditation.&nbsp;Whatever comes is okay. And if nothing is there, and there is no particular object, that is great! If there is a particular object, that is also great! So practice like that.\nNow, we are going to try this together in practice.\nPlease keep your meditation posture. Keep the spine loosely straight, and relax your body. And now, please rest your mind as it is, in open awareness.\n[Silent Meditation.]\nNow, please be aware of anything that comes to your mind. Just watch it. If nothing is there, be with the&nbsp;nothing.\n[Silent Meditation.]\nNow rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent Meditation.]\nOkay. How was it?\nThis is&nbsp;choiceless meditation.&nbsp;The difference between&nbsp;open awareness&nbsp;and this meditation is just tiny. They are not so different.&nbsp;Open awareness&nbsp;is mainly just&nbsp;being.&nbsp;There is a sense of presence, relaxation, or of being. If a thought comes, you do not care. You are not particularly watching the thought. You are not particularly blocking it. You are just&nbsp;being, resting. Thoughts come and go, emotions come and go, forms, sounds, or whatever else — you do not care about that. When you listen to a sound, if a \"pizza\" comes, you do not care, right? You just continue listening to the sound. So now, here, you just continue being or resting. If thoughts come and go, you do not care. That is&nbsp;open awareness. But&nbsp;choiceless meditation&nbsp;is that you are ready to watch whatever comes, \"forms, sounds, sensations, nothing. Okay. Oh, yes\". There is a readiness to watch. So there is a little bit of difference, right? But if you do not know the difference, who cares? As long as you are not lost, you are fine. 20 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nInquiry\nHow can you use this present moment to recognize awareness?\nTip\nWhen you have awareness, the objects of your meditation can change: the objects change while awareness remains.\nMeditating with Choiceless Awareness\nBegin session Begin by bringing awareness to your body, finding a posture that is loose and relaxed and, at the same time, upright and alert.\nTake a few slow, deep breaths and let your body and mind relax.\nAs your breath returns to its normal rate, let go of all the doing energy in the mind, and simply be present. Rest in open, effortless awareness.\nBefore starting the main practice, set the motivation that your meditation will benefit others. Main practice In this practice, you do not have to control your experience in any way. Whatever is happening in your body, mind, and surroundings is perfectly fine—just notice whatever is happening.&nbsp;\nAnything that arises in the field of awareness is a worthy support of meditation. There is no need to hold on to certain experiences or push away others. Simply be aware of whatever naturally occurs in your mind.\nWhere is your attention naturally going at this moment? See if you can bring awareness to that aspect of experience, whether it is something happening in your environment or something happening in your body or mind.&nbsp;\nThere will likely be some experiences that you will find pleasant, others unpleasant, and still others neutral. Regardless of what you are experiencing, see whether you can treat it as a passing experience, neither holding onto it nor pushing it away. Simply be aware of it.\nNotice whether there is a subtle impulse to hold on to some experiences or resist others. This tendency is fine. Just notice what it feels like, and see if you can bring awareness to this dynamic.&nbsp;\nThe point of meditation is not to feel any particular way. The point is simply to learn to be aware of whatever is happening in the present moment.&nbsp;\nOne of the most important qualities of this practice is curiosity. Notice the subtlety and nuance of your experience, observing it in its full richness.\nAnother important quality of this practice is friendliness and warmth. Observe all your experiences with a sense of acceptance, affection, and warmth. Try to treat even negative or challenging experiences with a sense of curiosity and openness.&nbsp; End Session If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them and just be present, resting in open awareness for a few moments.&nbsp;\nEnd by dedicating the benefits of your meditation, wishing your family, friends, and others to be well and happy. How do you experience choiceless awareness, as compared to remaining with one object throughout a session?

Normally, we call them \"normal awareness,\" \"meditative awareness,\" and \"pure awareness\". But actually, there is just one. But the level of awareness depends on your recognition. Even when we are not recognizing it, we all have awareness — that is&nbsp;normal&nbsp;awareness. Now, when you begin to meditate, then you recognize it, and that becomes&nbsp;meditative awareness. The last one is&nbsp;pure awareness&nbsp;— awareness beyond concept, beyond subject and object. That is what we sometimes call \"nature of mind\" practice. So, in the Path of Liberation, we focus a lot on&nbsp;pure awareness. Right now, within these courses, we are discussing&nbsp;meditative awareness.\nWhat are the differences between&nbsp;normal awareness&nbsp;and&nbsp;meditative awareness?&nbsp;Normal awareness&nbsp;is how we normally behave, like, \"Oh, be aware. Watch out. Be mindful.\" We all have that, right? If you are walking on the street and, especially, if there is a little bit of danger around, then you are alert and aware. That is&nbsp;normal awareness. This awareness is completely facing outward, it is narrow, and there are a lot of judgments. You are experiencing that kind of awareness but it is not so clear. It is like you are in the river. You feel you are carried away by the river, but you cannot see the river, right? It is just like that.\nThe second awareness is&nbsp;meditative awareness. Meditative awareness&nbsp;is when you recognize awareness. Actually, what is awareness? [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.] It is knowing. Just experiencing or knowing or being conscious. It is almost the same as mind. What is mind? The definition of mind is what we normally call \"clear and knowing.\" So, whatever experience you have, you know it. Whatever you see, you know it. So here, these all mean the same thing.\nWhen we recognize that we have this awareness — the knowing or cognition — then, based on that recognition of awareness we use, let's say our breath or listening to sounds, and the sounds become supports for maintaining that recognition. This is why all these meditation techniques become meditation — because of just knowing the idea of awareness and then wanting to practice that with an object. Then, that becomes meditation. This is what we normally call, \"view and motivation\". The intention will transform your experience. In this case, what is the view? It is to recognize awareness, the knowing quality of the mind. And the intention is, \"I want to meditate now with sounds.\" When you hear sounds, you will automatically recognize awareness. You do not need to worry, thinking, \"Okay, sound…Now, where is awareness? So, is there an awareness of awareness of the sound? And now, do I have to be aware of the awareness of listening to the sound, the consciousness?…\" There is no need to complicate it like that. Because the mind has a particular quality, which is self-luminosity. The mind knows itself. Even with a thought — the essence of thought is awareness. So it can recognize itself. Therefore, in the beginning, we try to connect to our own awareness through an object. The difference between&nbsp;normal awareness&nbsp;and&nbsp;meditative awareness&nbsp;is — well, actually, they are the same, right? You just recognize&nbsp;normal awareness&nbsp;as awareness, and then it becomes&nbsp;meditative awareness.\nBut, when you recognize it, in your own experience, there are some differences. The first one is a sense of non-judgmental quality. Whether you watch a visual object, listen to sounds, observe smells, thoughts, or whatever, it does not matter. The object is not so important, and it does not matter what kind of object there is — a good object, a bad object, beautiful, or not beautiful — it does not matter. So there is a sense of non-judgment. The main important thing is that you want to develop the recognition of awareness and maintain that awareness. That is the is a sense of non-judgment. Then there is a sense of freedom, a sense of spaciousness. When you see the river, you are out of the river, right? Normally, what we have in our minds is only thoughts, emotions, feelings, perceptions, memories, etc., that is all! But actually, your mind is more than that; it is more than thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and more than feelings. Awareness is like space, and all these thoughts, perceptions, memories, etc. are like clouds or galaxies or universes, right? The reason why we feel a sense of freedom is because, for example, for me, when I was young, when I watched the panic, then I saw that I was not the panic. I was watching it, so I was more than panic. There is spaciousness, and there is freedom. There are a lot of qualities like that when you really connect with awareness.\nThen, the third important point is that everything eventually becomes a support for awareness. All these — even what we normally feel is a cause of destruction, negative emotions, suffering, stress, or whatever — eventually can become supports for awareness or objects of awareness. And what is awareness? Awareness is always free, pure, and calm. Awareness also has more qualities of warmth, kindness, compassion, and wisdom. All of these are there. This is really important to know. But, at the same time, do not worry too much when you really meditate, thinking, \"Do I have this non-judgmental quality, spaciousness, and freedom? Is everything transforming into support for my meditation?\" You do not have to worry about it. As long as you do not become like a zombie, you are okay. As long as you do not become like… [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to be lost.] ...then you are okay.\nThe third is&nbsp;pure awareness. What is&nbsp;pure awareness? So first, we try to connect with awareness through objects like forms, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, thoughts, emotions — all these things — and then try to be with awareness, itself. Then, eventually, you are able to recognize awareness that is completely beyond subject and object, and beyond dualistic perception. Yet, everything is there in awareness. The mind becomes completely open. Then we can truly connect with our true nature, our basic nature, which is genuine and peaceful. There is freedom, and once we experience that, we cannot put it into words, but at the same time, we can experience it. That is the last stage, the last type of awareness. But actually, the last one —&nbsp;pure awareness&nbsp;— we have it right now, with us. We all have this wonderful nature within us. It depends on whether we have discovered it or not — that is the only issue. There is no issue whether we have it or not, whether we possess it or not. We all possess this great nature.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow would you describe the characteristics of, and differences between, the three types of awareness that Mingyur Rinpoche presents [!question] Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche says that the view and motivation change one's experience.

For me, the first time I learned this, it was really a relief.\nSo you are wondering now, \"What is this practice?\" This practice is what we call \"getting lost\" meditation. That means you can get lost now. Until now, for whatever meditation you learned, we said, \"Do not get lost. Do not get lost,\" right? But now, just get lost. Until now, for all the meditation techniques, we have said, \"Be aware. Awareness is important. Awareness is the essence of meditation.\" But now, no awareness. Forget about awareness. How nice! Right? Isn't it relieving? For me, I felt really happy and relieved the first time I learned this meditation technique.\nWhat you should do — and I am not joking, I am serious — when you practice this is to completely forget about the meditation, completely forget awareness, and forget about whatever meditation you are doing. Just get lost. If you become like a zombie — wonderful! You know how to get lost, right? I do not have to teach you that. You have known how since you were born. Getting lost we are born with, right? So, it is very easy for you. You just get lost. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You know how to do that and, probably, you have been doing this many, many times. Normally, we do it most of the time.\nBut there is one condition: when you are completely lost, and you forget, you have to raise your hand, just like this. The moment you know you are aware, put your hand down. So, when you are completely lost, raise your hand, then when awareness comes back, put your hand down. That is the practice. Do not be shy. If you are lost, raise your hand, okay? If you can raise it more times, it is more beneficial. Why? I will not tell you now. I will tell you this later.\nSo, now let's practice together.\nFirst, please keep your meditation posture. Relax the muscles in your body, and rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, please get lost. Forget about awareness. Forget about meditation. Just get lost.\n[Silent meditation.]\nDo not forget to get lost, okay?\n[Silent meditation.]\nWhen you are completely lost, raise your hand.\n[Silent meditation.]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation.]\nOkay, how was it? Easy or not easy? What? Not easy? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Are you sure? You do not know how to get lost? That is crazy, right? It is not easy to get lost? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Actually, it is not so easy. Which is good, no? Normally, we get lost. We do not have a problem getting lost. Now that we need to get lost… \"Huh, get lost!\" We cannot get lost. Awareness is everywhere, with forms, with sounds, with thoughts... That is great!\nI told you that if you can raise your hand more often, it is good, right? Why? Because if you raise your hand, that means you came back. The moment you know you are lost, you are aware. You are already connected with awareness.\nIf you are really lost, you cannot raise your hand. The moment when you know you are lost, then you are not lost anymore, right? So, if you raise your hand more often, it is great!\nSometimes you might doubt, \"Am I lost or not lost?\" Then raise your hand. If you can raise your hand, you are not lost anymore. If you do not raise your hand, then maybe you are lost, and you do not know you are lost. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But if you raise your hand, you can be one hundred percent sure that you are not lost. This is really nice! Then, there is no tension. There is no tension thinking, \"Be aware… Do not get lost...\" There are no things like that. Just get lost. Let the mind run free. But when you are really lost, you are not lost.\nFor me, this is one of the best meditation practices — it is one of my favorites! It is really beneficial to me, and I hope it will be beneficial to you. 25 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nTip\nIf you are unsure whether you recognize awareness or not, it is 100% sure that you are not lost.\nMeditating with \"Getting Lost\nBegin session (Remember: For this meditation, the more times you can get lost, the better!)\nBegin by finding a comfortable posture, allowing your body and mind to come together.\nSet the motivation that your meditation will benefit others.\nNext, let your mind rest in open awareness, simply letting everything be completely natural. Main practice As you rest in open awareness, if you notice that you have been carried away by thoughts or emotions, simply raise your hand or thumb and rest in open awareness once again.\nNext, you can pick a specific support like sound, a visual object, sensation, or something else. Use this object as support for awareness for a few moments.\nNow, try to get lost. Try to not be aware of the sound, pain, visual object, or whatever you choose. The more times you can get lost, the better.\nWhere is your mind now? Are you lost?\nNext, you can switch the object, choosing a different support, and follow the same instructions as above.&nbsp;\nJust allow the mind to get lost and raise your hand when this happens.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, drop what you are doing, and just rest in open awareness.&nbsp; End Session End the session by resting in open awareness before dedicating the benefits of your practice to others, extending the wish to be happy to your friends, family, and others. Do you find it easier or more difficult to recognize awareness when trying to get lost?

Do you remember the story about a little water that went into my ear and how I used water to remove the water? The best bodyguards are the robbers. So, the best antidote is&nbsp;self-antidote&nbsp;or&nbsp;self-liberation. You will be the best antidote for you. This is like the story about a little water going into the ear and using more water to free the water and the story about the robbers — not the machines, but the bandits, you know? Robbery. So, the best bodyguards are these robbers. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I think you understand. If your enemy becomes your friend, then he or she is the best bodyguard, right? That is really good for you. Then you would have no enemy. If the peacock eats poison and the poison becomes good for the peacock — all these things are what we call \"self-antidote\", or \"self-liberation\". What we have practiced until now is this kind of approach, what we call \"experiential practice,\" and this lineage focuses on experiential practice, so step-by-step, it will eventually lead to this&nbsp;self-liberation&nbsp;practice.&nbsp;\nMaybe I will tell you more in detail about how this works. Normally, our mind has what we call the \"causes of suffering.\" The causes of suffering are not the monkey mind, thoughts, emotions, feelings, nor perceptions but, rather, the relationship between you and perception, you and the monkey mind, and you and thoughts, feelings, and emotions — all of these.\nIt is all about the perspective. Let's say that thoughts are something disturbing for you, then the thoughts become obstacles for you. But if thoughts are something that supports you, something that is like your friend, then thoughts are good. That is not only with thoughts but with forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations — everything, all the phenomena — even with panic.\nI had my own experience with this. In the beginning, the relationship between my panic and me was not good. I hated my panic. I had panic&nbsp;of&nbsp;panic. I really wanted to get rid of my panic, so there was hatred or aversion. I was also craving some special experience — something peaceful, calm, and joyful. So, there was attachment and craving, and also the resistance, hatred, or aversion. Aversion and craving: these two are like when you drive a car, and you have the accelerator and the brakes. Without those, you cannot drive, right?\nOnce you let go of these two, then panic cannot really function by itself. In fact, for me, in the end, the panic was kind of exciting. When the panic came, whether panic was crying, burning, jumping, or screaming, it was all within awareness. So, basically, there was calmness, clarity, and a sense of lucidity, and it was not fixed. The panic, however, was fixed. But then, on the surface level, the panic was crying. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So our relationship changed.\nThis is not only true for panic but for everything. Right now, if you have finished or are at the end of this course, and if you practice this step-by-step, in the end, even if you want to get lost, you cannot get lost, right? When you want to get lost, even getting lost becomes a support for meditation. Let's say if you are confused: \"I do not know how to practice, hmmm.\" Just&nbsp;know&nbsp;that you are confused. If you know you are confused, the confusion becomes a support for your meditation. Also, let's say you feel dull and very drowsy, then just be aware of the dullness or the drowsiness and that becomes a support for meditation.\nWhat else? Strong emotions, hatred, stress, depression, panic — if you watch them, they can become supports for your meditation. Even getting lost becomes a support for your meditation, right? If you feel lazy: \"Okay, I do not want to practice.\" Watch the feeling of laziness, and laziness becomes a support for your meditation.\nCan you find any obstacles to meditation? Let's think. What do you think? Doubt is not an obstacle. Dullness is not an obstacle. Emotions are not an obstacle. Thoughts are not an obstacle. Of course, sounds and forms — all these are not obstacles. Pain is not an obstacle. What else? Having the wrong view? If you watch the wrong view, the wrong view becomes a support for meditation, so it is also not an obstacle.\nThere is only one obstacle to your meditation. Otherwise, there are no obstacles. Should I tell you what the one obstacle is or do you want to find out? Should I tell you? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Okay, I will tell you. The one obstacle is...forgetting&nbsp;to watch. That is all. And that is only if you do not know you are forgetting. That is the only obstacle to meditation. How wonderful! But, of course, it will not happen at the beginning. You have to practice step-by-step and, still, you will forget. Come back, forget, come back, and try again and again, and eventually, it will become better.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that suffering does not come from outside circumstances, but from how we relate to those circumstances. Why do you think this is? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche says that the only obstacle to meditation is forgetting to recognize awareness, but he also says that even getting lost can become a support for meditation. How do you reconcile the two? Points to remember:\nSelf-liberation means to use the very thing that troubles you in order to be free from it.\nSuffering is not inherent in experiences. Suffering comes from our relationships to these experiences.\nEven getting lost can be a support for meditation.\nIf you know you are confused, confusion becomes a support for meditation.\nThe only obstacle to meditation is forgetting to recognize awareness.

It is your life.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nTo apply the stillness, movement, and awareness meditation in everyday life, just remember this practice. Actually, whatever happens, just be with that. You do not need to meditate. Just observe or witness whatever habits you have in everyday life, maybe when you are having food, drinking something, working at your workplace, doing some physical exercise, using a restroom, or having a meeting. Everywhere, whatever you do, the same saying applies: \"You can meditate everywhere, anytime, with any circumstances.\" Just bring awareness.\nIf your mind is moving, be with that. Let it move. Of course, when you have a meeting, you have to think, right? It is okay. Be with the thinking. Sometimes you have to think in such a way that it becomes like analytical meditation. When you think with awareness, then thinking becomes like analytical meditation. That is good for whatever work you do. But of course, if you think of harmful things and grasp at that, then it is not good. It is harmful to others. Otherwise, whatever thinking arises, let it come and do not grasp at it. Just be aware, and then it is okay.\nThere are two things. Grasping means you lose awareness, you get caught up in whatever thinking, and you bring that into action. In that case, especially negative thinking is not good. But neutral thoughts, of course, or positive thoughts, even if you bring them into action, are no problem. \"I want to drink tea or coffee\": you have that thought, you can be with it, and you can drink. Of course, in everyday life, you have to function, so you have to put thoughts into action, right? That is okay.\nBut, when you are angry and being with the anger, and then hit others, that is not good. So control negative emotions. Do not put them into action. If you can just be with a negative emotion, it is okay. Just do not act on that negative emotions.\nBut, if you want to make plans at your office, you think and make an effort. You might especially think, \"How do I make this job successful, meaningful, and beneficial?\" That is okay. That is purposely thinking, so that becomes like an analytical meditation, when you have awareness. That is vertical liberation.\nBut as for anger, do not make anger. As for hatred, do not make hatred. As for panic, do not make panic. But if panic automatically comes, it is okay. Be with that. If hatred automatically comes, be with that. Just do not put it into action. And then all this becomes support for meditation, so it becomes movement meditation.\nThen in between, you might have a gap, especially when you are resting. \"Haaah.\" Or when you are looking at special art, there is a gap in your mind. Or you are looking at a river. \"Oh.\" Or the mountains. Or an unexpected surprise comes into your life. There is a gap. Be with that. Or you are practicing open awareness meditation, just being. That is also like stillness.\nTry this in your life, every day. It will be really good for improving your meditation.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a moment to reflect on a time and place in which you will practice stillness, movement, and awareness in daily life. Whenever you decide to do this, simply notice that awareness is always present, regardless of whether your mind is still or moving. Notice when you are trying to change the state your mind is in, and let that be the reminder for simply being with whatever is present. The more times you can catch yourself trying to change the state of your mind, the better.Journal Reflection Questions\nHow does practicing stillness, movement, and awareness in everyday life compare to practicing on the cushion? Is it easier or more challenging?\nWhat is it like to rest the mind on awareness itself rather than on a support like sound or a visual object as you go about your day? Have you noticed anything in particular?\nTip\nYour mind is either still or moving. Regardless of which is happening, awareness is always present.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.3.8 Stillness Movement and Awareness Summary\" data-href=\"1.3.8 Stillness Movement and Awareness Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.8-stillness-movement-and-awareness-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["1.3.8 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(5_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Stillness, Movement, and Awareness: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Stillness,_Movement,_and_Awareness_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.8-stillness-movement-and-awareness-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.8-stillness-movement-and-awareness-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474214,"modifiedTime":1759272586111,"sourceSize":4836,"sourcePath":"1.

First, feel your body. Relax the muscles in your body, from your head to your feet.\nNow. rest your mind in open awareness. Just let it be as it is.\n[Silent Meditation]\nRight now, simply observe your state of mind. Maybe you are thinking or feeling something. Or maybe you cannot find any particular thought or emotion. This is the gap. So be with the gap. Be with the horizontal liberation.\nOr, when you are being with the gap, suddenly a thought or emotion may appear. Be with that. Or the sensations in your body. Or a to-do list. Or just feeling unhappy. Or feeling happy, at peace, joy, or clarity. Or anxiety, depression, or hatred. It does not matter.\nJust be with it. Just witness it. Observe it. If you feel you cannot really see whether your mind is moving or resting, if you do not know if it is stillness or movement, then be with that. Be with the not-knowing. As long as you have not lost the intention to meditate, as long as you have not become like a zombie, you are okay.\n[Silent Meditation]\nMaybe your state of mind is stillness. Some of you, the moment a thought comes, you look at that thought or emotion, or whatever appears in your mind, and then all these particular thoughts and emotions are gone, and your mind is in a nonconceptual state, in the gap. You can stay in the gap as long as the gap is there.\n[Silent Meditation]\nNo matter what happens, your mind is always clear and knowing. The basic fundamental quality of your mind is clear and knowing.\n[Silent Meditation]&nbsp;\nNow, slowly open your eyes, and continue to be with the movement or stillness of mind. This is very easy. You do not have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything. Just be. There is no such thing as making mistakes here. If you feel like you are making a mistake, be with the mistake. Then the mistake also becomes a support for meditation.&nbsp;\nOkay.&nbsp;\nPlease continue to practice like that. Whatever you have learned until now — all those meditations become stillness or movement meditations. The main thing here is the&nbsp;being. The&nbsp;being&nbsp;is awareness. 25 minutes of formal meditation each day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nInquiry\nIs my mind in a state of stillness or movement right now?\nMeditating with Stillness, Movement, and Awareness\nBegin session Begin by sitting upright and taking a few deep breaths, allowing your body and mind to unwind and relax.\nSet the motivation that your practice will benefit yourself and others.\nNotice the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body. Notice what that feels like.&nbsp;\nAs your breathing returns to normal, rest in open, effortless awareness. Main practice As you rest in awareness, you may notice that sometimes your mind is still, and other times it is in motion—moving with thoughts and emotions. You do not have to try to control any of that. Simply notice the state of your mind right now. Just notice what it feels like when your mind is still—calm and relaxed—and when it is moving. Notice what thoughts, feelings, or memories are moving through your mind.\nYou are not trying to have more experiences of stillness and fewer experiences of movement. Rather, you are learning to see that awareness is always present, no matter what state the mind is in.\nNext, bring your awareness to your breath, and let your awareness gently rest on the sensation of the breath as you are breathing in and out. As your awareness rests on the breath, your mind might feel a little bit more settled than it normally does. Notice how awareness permeates this experience of the settled mind; i.e., not only is the mind calm, but you are aware that the mind is calm. Simply notice that awareness.\nNext, find another support for your awareness, like a sound, visual object, or physical sensation. Rest your attention on that support, and see whether you can tune into the knowing presence of awareness that is always with you.\nNow, let go of the support, and allow thoughts, memories, and impressions to naturally arise in your mind. All of these are what we refer to as \"movement\"—the inner movements of the mind itself. Notice how awareness accompanies all the inner movements. You know that they are happening as they happen. Just notice that quality of awareness.&nbsp;\nUsually, we are more focused on what is happening in the mind than on the mind itself. However, here we are attending to awareness itself. No matter if the mind is calm or moving, notice that awareness is present.\nCompletely let go of trying to control the state your mind is in. It is always going to be in a state of stillness, or in a state of movement. Simply be aware, regardless of the state your mind is in. End session If your eyes have been closed, you can slowly open them and just rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nEnd your practice session by dedicating the benefit to others.

Then we also have open awareness meditation in which you are not particularly looking at any object, but just being. Awareness is being with itself. It looks like there are a lot of meditation techniques, right? I think you all know by now that, although it looks like there are a lot, the essence is one. Remember what the one is? Could you repeat it? I cannot hear you. [Mingyur Rinpoche jokingly cups his ear as if he wants to hear the answer.] Awareness. You all know it is awareness! In our tradition, what we call \"stillness, movement, and awareness meditation\" is how we put all these meditations together with a very simple meditation technique. For this simple meditation technique, we normally say that our mind has two moments, or two situations. And these two situations are movement and stillness. \"Movement\" means that our mind is busy — busy with thoughts, busy with emotions, it is moving. \"Blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.\" Or a lot of different audio, video, and feelings or sensations come to our mind. This is what we call \"movement.\" The second is what we call \"stillness,\" and it means there is a gap. For example, when you look at a thought, it disappears, right? There is a gap. Sometimes when you look at an emotion, it disappears. There is a gap. And sometimes in open awareness, there is also a gap. In open awareness, you are not looking for any particular object of meditation. You just be, right? Normally I mention \"horizontal liberation\" and \"vertical liberation.\" The horizontal liberation is the gap. Between the past and the future, there is a gap. One thought is gone, and the next thought has not come yet. That is a gap. An emotion disappears when you look for it, and the next has not come yet. There is a gap. The example is waiting at the bus stop, right? Remember? You are waiting for the bus, but there is no bus. Then, suddenly the bus comes, and as soon as you try to enter the bus, the bus leaves. Again, there is a gap. So horizontal liberation is the stillness. As for vertical liberation, there are thoughts, emotions, feelings, perceptions, forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations. Everything is there, moving, coming, and going. That is \"movement.\" Our mind has two possibilities: it may be still, or it may be moving. Normally, what we have is a lot of movement. Sometimes there is stillness. Normally, stillness occurs less, but still, there is stillness, even if you never learned meditation before. But here the new thing we need to learn is . . . I think you know, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Now, of course, we have these two situations with us. Our mind has these two situations: stillness and movement. So now, what do we need? Just having this stillness and movement of mind will not become meditation. In order for it to become meditation, we need something else. What is that something else? What is the third thing? Can you repeat it? It is awareness. The third is awareness. When we recognize awareness and are with awareness, then stillness becomes meditation, and movement becomes meditation. The key point here is awareness. When you are aware of thoughts, emotions, and feelings, everything becomes meditation, right? If you think, \"I do not know how to meditate and be with those thoughts,\" those thoughts become meditation. If you feel like your mind becomes very dry, and it looks like you have no idea how to meditate — \"I cannot meditate at all\" — be with that thought, be with that feeling. That is meditation. That is \"movement.\" All movement becomes meditation. Just be with it. You do not have to do any particular thing. Doing versus being. Just be. Then movement becomes meditation. Then, sometimes our mind becomes quiet, without so much thought and emotion. And sometimes you have a very clear gap. Sometimes your mind cannot really grab anything, but you can be with that. The natural quality of the mind is that it is clear and knowing. The mind is always clear and knowing. Even if you feel dull, you know you are experiencing dullness. So it is clear! And you know there is dullness. That is clarity. The mind is clear and knowing with emotions or whatever. The mind is always like a lamp. The natural quality of a lamp is to illuminate, to have clarity. And our mind is always like that, whether we recognize it or not. Just be with whatever there is. Sometimes there is horizontal liberation, a gap. Or sometimes there is vertical liberation, and you have a lot of thoughts and emotions. All these become meditation. That is the main point of all these practices. And this is a really important practice. Normally, we have analytical meditation and resting meditation. All of Joy of Living level one is resting meditation. We do not need to analyze. The analytical meditation begins with Joy of Living level two. And particularly in level three, we have analytical meditation. This meditation — stillness, movement, and awareness — is very important to go to a deeper level of awareness meditation, a deeper level of your fundamental nature, or true nature. We will know what is deep about this in the future. Right now, what we need to understand is that whatever comes into our mind, whatever we experience, can only be one of two possibilities — maybe the mind is in movement, or in stillness. Both can become meditation. Normally people only like the horizontal one, the stillness, the gap. People do not like the vertical one, the movement. But actually, both are the same. What matters here is awareness. Awareness is to be with whatever comes. You just be with it, as it is.

In order to do so, I would like to share a little story with you. When I was younger, I was lucky enough to travel to Istanbul, and I remember that once, after a very long day of walking and discovery throughout this beautiful city, I found myself in front of a building from the 16th century. It was in the Tofane area on the eastern side of the city, and this building was actually a Turkish bath. I decided to enter, and what I discovered when I entered the building was absolutely amazing. I was completely blown away by the wonders and the beauty of the art unfolding in front of my eyes. I was so amazed that not only did I have the feeling that the beauty of the art was unfolding in front of my eyes but also that it was unfolding inside me. After a moment of silence and wonder in front of this beauty, a guy came up to me and asked me to follow him through the Turkish bath ritual. It is important to know that the Turkish baths have a very old tradition of caring for the body and the mind. After having done this long ritual for several hours, I went out of the building, and I felt so light, so free, so open, and so good that I even had the feeling that I could walk into the sky. For me, this little story illustrates the benefit of all the practices we have been able to discover through this program. In one way, when we started the program, we discovered that, along with our awareness, our basic goodness was unfolding. This basic goodness is nothing more than the expression of our love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. For me, the discovery is exactly the same discovery that I made when I was in this Turkish bath in Istanbul. When we are able to connect to our basic goodness, it is really like art unfolding in front of our eyes and in our hearts. Going through the process of all these practices of love, compassion, joy, and equanimity for ourselves, for a loved one, for a neutral person, for a difficult person, or for all beings is exactly like this long traditional ritual of the Turkish bath. It is an inner process that helps you to feel the lightness, the space, and the openness of your inner qualities. So, this is the end of the program, and I would like to tell you how wonderful it was for me, along with Myoshin, to support you throughout this wonderful journey. You now have a lot of practices that you can do to support your life. But I would like you to never forget that you already have a soft spot within you where there is an expression of care and tenderness, and this is your basic goodness. Thank you! Conclusion by Myoshin Kelley Read\nHi everyone. I just want to say a big congratulations to you! You have made it to the end of this module on meditating with the quality of love or loving-kindness. I hope that this has been a rich exploration for you and one that you do not just leave here, because really, these other qualities of compassion, joy, and equanimity are so tied in with the practice that you have already done.&nbsp;\nI think it will be fun for you to discover how these qualities are supporting each other all the time, even though at times it may be one particular quality that we are using as the access point to knowing something of our true nature, our essential nature. Also, I find that all of these four qualities are what help support me in my relationship with others in life. I actually see them come into play at different times, and there is just so much richness in this.&nbsp;\nI am hoping that you will continue on with the program. There can be a lifetime of discovery with this. I remember at one point I was doing a long, intensive retreat, and after my first week — and I had only practiced with loving-kindness at that time — I remember going to my teacher in an interview and saying to them, \"The world would be a different place if everybody did a week of retreat with this practice.\"&nbsp;\nI think it is really true. I think there is a way — that I found, anyway — that my vision of the world and my place in it all shifted as my heart softened and opened, both to myself and those around me.\nI wish you well in your discovery of what these qualities are, and if you continue on, I hope to see you somewhere down the path. And I just wish for everyone that you could know true happiness. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2 Compassion\" data-href=\"2.2 Compassion\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2-compassion.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Go to Next Course →</a>","aliases":["2.1 Love, Conclusion - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1 love, conclusion - Tergar joy of living course","2.1 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2-compassion.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1-love-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474745,"modifiedTime":1759272586158,"sourceSize":5742,"sourcePath":"1.

Congratulations to all of you! You have finished level one, so you are now advanced meditators. [Mingyur Rinpoche claps his hands and laughs.]\nThe joy of Living level two is all about love and compassion. It is a little more difficult than level one. For level one, the main important thing is awareness. As long as you are aware, you do not have to do anything, right? You are not leading in any direction, you are not analyzing either, and it does not matter what kinds of thoughts, emotions, or feelings come. In Joy of Living level one, we discussed that the essence of meditation is awareness. Awareness is like the sky, and all thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and memories are like clouds. So the important point is… Do you remember the secret? You all have awareness all the time, but what is missing? We are not recognizing it. We are not recognizing our own awareness. So, in Joy of Living level one, you just recognize awareness.\nHow to recognize awareness? In level one, there is a step-by-step practice. We try to connect awareness with sound, the body, form, smell, taste, etc. Basically, we use all the perceptions of the six senses: form, sound, smell, taste, sensation, and then thoughts and even emotions. You can connect with awareness through all these objects, step-by-step. Then, one of the most important practices is open awareness meditation: awareness is being with itself, without any particular focus. Just be.\nAll these are the practices you already did in the Joy of Living level one. These are really important, and for these, there is really no judging, regardless of whether you have good or bad thoughts, positive or negative thoughts, happiness or pain. I used my panic when I was young. I used my panic as support for my meditation. So, the key point is… Do you remember? Recognition. Recognize awareness.\nAwareness is your nature. It is there with you. You do not have to make awareness or create awareness; you just need to connect with awareness. And remember that awareness is like the sky. Be with that. These practices are in level one, and you already did them, so I just wanted to recap. This is really important to remember going into level two.\nNow, when we come to level two, of course, we have our true or fundamental nature. Just like we have awareness, we also have love and compassion. I will tell you more about this later. But love and compassion are our fundamental nature, just like awareness. Maybe you do not believe that. I did not believe it either when I was young. I thought, \"Do I have love and compassion all the time? How crazy.\" But now I believe it. It is there! In the beginning, when you begin to learn Joy of Living one, you may not believe that we have awareness with us all the time, 24 hours a day. But I think you believe it now, right? It is the same thing with love and compassion.\nFor the practice, to connect with love and compassion, we use analytical meditation. For analytical meditation, we have to guide our mind and analyze, so it is a little more difficult than Joy of Living level one. Therefore, we put love and compassion meditation in level two, because without level one, without connecting with awareness and being a little familiar with your own mind, practicing loving-kindness and compassion is quite difficult. That is why I was telling you that you are all a little advanced as meditators.\nOf course, there is no need to be really advanced. No problem. Maybe some of you are still in the \"waterfall experience\". Remember the waterfall experience? This is when you feel like you are getting worse and have more thoughts and emotions. That is also okay. No problem — that is a good sign. But now you are ready to practice level two. I hope you will benefit from joining level two. And together, we will take this journey of compassion and love.\nWatch Read\nFor level 2, the main practice normally includes the view, meditation, and application — three things. So, why do we need to combine these three? Because, with the thinking mind, we know the reasoning, logic, and all this, but if you stop there and do not have the feeling mind, the heart, your practice will not come alive. Or maybe you have some feeling and follow your heart — the experiential part — but you do not know the reasoning, the \"why?\" \"how?\" and \"what?\". Then you may also get lost. So you need to combine these two together. But if you combine them and do not know how to apply them in everyday life, then you do not build a habit. Habit is really important. Some people love meditation and know how to meditate very well on the conceptual level. They practice a little bit and have a nice feeling, but then forget to apply it in everyday life. Then you do not build a habit. Even if you meditate for a long time, you cannot really transform much. It is important to apply it in everyday life to build a new habit — this is the application. So these three (view, meditation, and application) are important. The essence of level 2 is to connect with love and compassion, which we all have all the time, twenty-four hours a day, just as we have awareness. Then, after connecting with this love and compassion — recognizing this is the view — we need not only to understand that we have love and compassion but also to apply it in practice. The way to apply this — to get the real experience, the heart, the application, the experiential part — is to practice meditation step by step. There are five steps to this meditation. The first is to connect with love and compassion within yourself. The second is love and compassion for someone whom you like. The third is love and compassion for a neutral person — someone you neither like nor hate. The fourth is love and compassion for someone whom you do not like. This one is quite difficult. And the fifth is what we call \"immeasurable love\" and \"immeasurable compassion.\" These five come step by step. First is love — sometimes called \"loving-kindness,\" which has the same meaning — second is compassion, third is joy, and last is equanimity. In level 2, the main practice is what we sometimes call the \"four immeasurables\": immeasurable love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. For each of these, but especially for the first three, we have to practice the five steps of meditation step by step. This is how to gain experience. After finishing this, then you not only need to practice on the cushion, but you also have to apply it in everyday life, especially when you are facing strong emotions — such as panic, like I had when I was young, or stress, hatred, depression, or any other problem or affliction. You need to transform all of these into support for love and compassion. This is just like working with awareness in Joy of Living Level 1 when you transform all your afflictions and sufferings into support for awareness. Now, in level 2, we transform everything into loving-kindness and compassion. You need to apply this in everyday life, in many different aspects of your life. Basically, you can apply and meditate on love and compassion everywhere, anytime, and under any circumstances. If we combine awareness and compassion, then we can transform. We will discover our true nature — the fundamental quality of ourselves, which is amazing — first by focusing on awareness and now by focusing on compassion. And in the future, we will focus on wisdom. So I hope you will transform soon.\nWelcome from Frédéric Auquier Frédéric Auquier has been practicing and studying meditation since 2001, and has been a student of Mingyur Rinpoche since 2003.

So now, you need to apply this in everyday life; this is what we call \"application.\" It is really important. Today, I will give you homework that you can do after watching this video and after your formal meditation practice — when you go into your daily life. Maybe it could be when you go to your office, do some physical exercise, go to a meeting, drink tea or coffee, or have lunch, dinner, or breakfast — it does not matter. At that time, you need to connect with your basic love, which is the wish to be happy. The moment you see something and think, \"I like it\" or \"I do not like it\" — this feeling is always there. \"I like...\" comes from love. \"I don't like...\" comes from compassion.Make a note of this today. Or use an app to note when you connect with love. For example, when you see coffee, \"Oh! I like coffee\" — this feeling. \"Oh, I don't like it.\" When you like or do not like something, these two feelings are two sides of the same coin. Love and compassion are two sides of the same coin. So the feeling is always there. You just have to recognize, connect with, and stay with that feeling. For those of you who are using a mala, you can use it for this. Whenever you connect with this, count it. Try to do at least ten times per day, or more if you want to, but ten times is a good number. Especially when you have strong hatred or anger, look at the basic level of that. Hatred is only on the surface level, but on a deeper level, you want to be good and nice — to be happy, right? Connect with that feeling. That really helps. Eventually, hatred will dissolve into love and compassion. But, of course, that may not be today. Do not expect that today or right now. So, do this homework to connect with your basic goodness, which is love.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a moment to reflect on your upcoming day or week. Choose a particular activity, like going to the gym or doing the dishes. Cultivate the wish to bring awareness to the ways you express your love—the wish to be happy and have the causes of happiness—during this activity. As you go about your activities, try to notice this at least ten times per day.Journal Reflection QuestionsWhat are you hoping to learn from this course?

This is the introduction to level 2 of the Joy of Living series, Opening the Heart.\nRight now, we are going to fully enter this path — this journey to open our hearts. In order to do so, we are going to be introduced to a very important concept, which is actually not so much a concept but a reality that we are able to experiment with every day, every second, every moment, and this is what Rinpoche calls \"basic goodness.\"\nFor me, basic goodness is really this orientation to be kind that we are able to express and feel in a lot of our actions. And I remember one teaching of Mingyur Rinpoche when he was talking about basic goodness. The way he introduced us to this notion of basic goodness as being with us all the time, 24 hours a day, was by using a very simple example, and at that time he was using the example of doing the dishes.\nIn the beginning, I was wondering in what way doing the dishes is connected with my basic goodness. But actually, the more I was able to contemplate this idea — even at the moment I was doing the dishes — of what the impulse in me was, the more I realized that the impulse was connected with a sense of care, a sense of kindness, an expression of love, and an expression of care for myself and for others.\nSo, I will really encourage you to listen to Mingyur Rinpoche's teaching with the biggest curiosity that you can get, and try to be as honest as possible and to find the simplest example in your daily life to get access to this ever-present treasure which is basic goodness. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.1 Intro to Basic Goodness View\" data-href=\"2.1.1 Intro to Basic Goodness View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.1-intro-to-basic-goodness-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.1 Intro To Basic Goodness, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.1 intro to basic goodness, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.1 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Basic Goodness (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Basic_Goodness_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.1-intro-to-basic-goodness-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.1-intro-to-basic-goodness-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474715,"modifiedTime":1759272586183,"sourceSize":2204,"sourcePath":"1.

Actually, love is there — you do not need to analyze anything, but rather, just recognize it. But to find this love, which is there within you, takes time. Therefore, we need to use analytical meditation. First, I would like to introduce you to the meaning of analytical meditation. Analytical meditation is like when you practiced thought meditation in Joy of Living level 1. You can have thoughts that do not disappear, like watching \"inner television.\" Right? Do you remember watching inner television? Thoughts are continuous, like, \"I want to go to a restaurant. I am going to have a healthy vegetable salad.\" \"Okay, now I am going to the restaurant… I am reaching the restaurant... Now I am ordering the food… Now the food is coming... I am having food.\" You can follow that, right? You do not have to make thoughts. You do not have to block thoughts. If thoughts come continuously, you can watch. Now, here, we need to think intentionally. In Joy of Living level 1, you do not need to think. You do not need to think intentionally. If a thought comes, you watch it; if a thought disappears, you let it disappear. But here, you need to guide your mind to look for this love within yourself. First, maybe we will try this with just a regular, normal, basic activity. Imagine that you are going to a restaurant, ordering the food, and then having the food, okay?We will try this together. Please keep your spine loosely straight. Relax your body. Now, first, rest your mind in open awareness for a few seconds. [Silent meditation.] Now, think that you are going to have food in the restaurant. You are on the way to the restaurant. Now you reach the restaurant. And now you are ordering a salad. You are waiting for your food. Now the salad came. \"Wow, I am going to have a nice salad!\" Rest in open awareness again, for a few seconds. [Silent meditation.] Okay, done! How was it? A little bit difficult, right? When you want to think, sometimes the thought breaks: \"I want to go to the re- re- res- res- restaurant... Oh yeah, yeah, ordering food...\" That is normal. Just like that.&nbsp;Now, in the same way, we are going to use the same style of analytical meditation to find love within ourselves. So what is love? It is the feeling that you want to be happy. Now, please connect with that feeling. Look for that feeling. Be aware of that.&nbsp;We are going to try this together, again. Please keep your meditation posture and be in open awareness. [Silent meditation.] Now, please be aware of the feeling of wanting to be happy. When you look for this feeling of wanting to be happy, maybe you cannot find it. But actually, your wanting to find this feeling now is the feeling. \"Oh, I cannot find this feeling. I wish I could. I want to find it.\" It is there already! It is with you right now, but you are not recognizing it. Right now, you have it. While watching this video, you have it. While you are listening to my voice, you have this feeling. When you cannot find this feeling, you feel unhappy, right? And you want to find it, right? Your wanting to find this feeling is love. Okay, now rest in open awareness. [Silent meditation.] Okay, this is the meditation on how to connect with our basic goodness, which is with us all the time — love — but which we do not recognize. So we try to recognize this through this analytical meditation. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice\nMeditating with Love and Basic Goodness\nBegin session Begin by bringing awareness into your body. Notice the fundamental wish to be happy—this has guided you to the practice here today.&nbsp;\nBring as much relaxation into the body as possible. You could imagine lying down in a grass field or slipping into a warm tub. Use whatever technique helps you connect with relaxation.&nbsp;\nNow, rest in open awareness. There is nothing to do. Just let go, and simply be.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Next, turn your attention within. See whether you can notice how the impulse to meditate, right now, is an expression of your fundamental wish to be happy.&nbsp;\nBring to mind experiences you have had in the past few days or weeks in which you can see this wish directly. Simply explore these activities and notice what comes up for you.\nAs is comfortable, extend back further in time. Think of activities you engaged in. See whether you can notice this fundamental wish as it is expressed in these activities. Keep in mind, these activities do not need to be dramatic life events. In fact, they could be quite ordinary. In this practice, we are simply training in the ability to see this wish in our activities.&nbsp;\nNow, bring yourself back to this moment. Can you bring the wish to be happy and flourish into the present moment? Can you notice this wish arising at this moment? Keep exploring and see whether you can bring this fundamental wish into focus.&nbsp;\nA possible reflection: Zoom out and consider why you are doing this course. What brought you to this point to make time for meditation?\nFor these last few moments, consider the activities you will engage in over the coming days. Cultivate the intention to be aware of the wish to be happy and to flourish throughout whatever you do. End session Now, drop the reflection and rest your mind in open awareness. Open your eyes (if they have been closed) and take in the richness and beauty of this moment.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you bring awareness to this basic wish to be happy, does it feel accessible, and are you able to observe it? Explain why or why not.How do you experience analytical meditation? Do you find it supportive? Why or why not?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.1 Intro to Basic Goodness Application\" data-href=\"2.1.1 Intro to Basic Goodness Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.1-intro-to-basic-goodness-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.1 Intro To Basic Goodness, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.1 intro to basic goodness, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Basic Goodness: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Basic_Goodness_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Basic Goodness: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Basic_Goodness_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.1-intro-to-basic-goodness-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.1-intro-to-basic-goodness-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474715,"modifiedTime":1759272586189,"sourceSize":7478,"sourcePath":"1.

We all have this basic goodness. It does not matter who you are. It does not matter what your cultural background is. It does not matter what your location is. We all have this basic goodness. What is basic goodness? Awareness, compassion, wisdom, skills, capacities, power... We all have wonderful qualities within us. Now here, in Joy of Living level 2, we will focus on love and compassion. This love and compassion are also part of basic goodness. Just like awareness, you have this love and compassion 24/7 — 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You might wonder, \"How can this be true? Sometimes I am angry, or I feel hatred. There are a lot of bad people in this world — how can they all have this love and compassion?\" Actually, they do. We all have it. The traditional example is that of a bird's nest — sometimes the mother bird flies away, and even though the bird goes very far away, it always wants to return to the nest. Why is that? It is because the nest is the bird's real home. So it is the same with all of us. No matter how lost we are in concepts, emotions, and the circumstances of the ups and downs of our life, on a deeper level we always want to go back to our home, our true nature. Now, the really important thing is this: what is that feeling? Love and compassion are feelings. The feeling of love and compassion is with you 24 hours. Quite strange, right? I want you to find it. I want to ask you to find it. Maybe we can do a short discussion for five minutes or something — think about it by yourself, maybe, or write it down. If you are with your friends, you can discuss it with them; otherwise, just think about it and write your thoughts on a piece of paper. What is this feeling of love and compassion that is with you 24 hours a day? Okay, now you have to do this as a written exercise. You can write whatever you think shows that love and compassion are with you 24 hours a day. Love and compassion are feelings — motivations and intentions. Try to look for that which is with you 24 hours a day. I will see you in a few minutes. How was it? Did you find the answer? [Mingyur Rinpoche cups his hand to his ear.] I cannot hear you. (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.) Of course, I cannot hear you, but normally when I teach this exercise, many people say that everybody has a basic level of love and compassion, that the feeling is that it is easy to forget, and that everybody tries to develop love and compassion. And some people say, \"When I hate, even hatred is coming out of love and compassion.\" I like this answer; actually, even hatred comes from love and compassion. How? The essence of love is actually wanting to be happy — wanting happiness for you, for others, or whoever. So basically, the essence of love is looking for happiness, to be free, good, peaceful, and nice. And the essence of compassion is wanting to be free from suffering, problems, and obstacles. Everybody wants to be happy, don't they? Do you want to be happy or not? If you want to be happy, raise your hand. [Mingyur Rinpoche raises his hand.] Of course everybody wants to be happy. Why are you watching this video now? It is because you are looking for happiness. You are thinking, \"If I watch this video and join this Joy of Living course, it may benefit me.\" I do not know how much benefit you will get from this, but you are looking for happiness (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs). And while you are watching right now, maybe you are watching like this or something like this, or maybe you have back pain, and you are like this, or maybe you do this, or this, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche changes position several times.] With each movement, you are looking for happiness. With each eyeblink, you are also looking for happiness, right? Each blink, you know? You are looking for happiness, looking for happiness... [Mingyur Rinpoche blinks his eyes several times.] With each breath, you are also looking for happiness. If you do not breathe, there is a problem. With every movement, every eyeblink, and every breath, you are looking for happiness. Therefore, this feeling of looking for happiness is with us all the time, 24 hours a day. It does not matter who you are, right? And this is not only with humans but with all beings, like animals. All beings have this feeling. This feeling is what we call a sign of basic goodness. As I mentioned before in the example of the bird's nest, the bird goes away from the nest but always wants to return to it. Why? The real home for the bird is the nest, and for us, our real home is our true nature. Our fundamental nature is really great, free from suffering, peaceful, and profound, so we all want to go back to our true nature. We get homesick. Do you know what homesickness is? Sometimes I travel a lot, so I get homesick. We all get homesick, but then the problem is knowing the right way to return home — whether we know the right way, the right path, or the right road to return home. That is the issue. Sometimes we are lost. Most of the time, we are lost. Therefore, the important thing here is that we need to recognize love and compassion, which are with us all the time. Even hatred comes from that. So at the surface level, there is hatred, but on a deep level, you care about something. Maybe you think that this is the right way, and they are not doing it the right way, so then you do not like them. You feel hatred. But on a deeper level —when you go deeper and deeper into that — there is love and compassion. The first time I heard that we all have love and compassion, I did not believe it. I thought it was just a saying, you know? A nice idea. But then I practiced and practiced and, eventually, this practice became really powerful. And for me, it was really beneficial to know that I do not need to fight with my hatred. I just connect with love and compassion, which is with us all the time, and then the hatred automatically dissolves into love and compassion.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche discusses how love and compassion are natural expressions of your fundamental nature, even when you are angry or upset. Can you explain why this is the case? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche uses an example of a bird returning to its nest to illustrate how we are all homesick for our true nature. Can you provide an example of your own that illustrates the same idea?

It seemed that my mind was becoming more agitated rather than more peaceful. 'Don't worry,' my teachers told me. 'Your mind isn't getting worse. Actually, what's happening is that you're simply becoming more aware of activity that has been going on all the time without your noticing it.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nTo apply this practice in everyday life is application. It is really important to bring this meditation into our lives and to build new habits. Otherwise, on your cushion, you may feel that there is love within you all the time, but if as soon as you are off the cushion you forget, then you cannot transform. You cannot transform the emotions, suffering, and difficult situations in your life into love. But if you apply this and you connect it with everyday life, eventually you can transform them. Of course, you cannot transform them tomorrow or next month; it takes some time. But eventually, you will. I would like to suggest a few simple tips to help you connect with this basic love. Although basic love is with us all the time, the problem is that — because it is there all the time — it is not easy to recognize, it is not easy to connect with. Therefore, I would like to first suggest that you look for some events in everyday life that you are looking forward to doing. For example, when you get up in the morning you want to take a shower, right? A nice shower. That is also looking for happiness — connect with that. And then you want to have a cup of coffee or tea or whatever you want — that is also looking for happiness. At times like these, remember to connect with the feeling of looking for happiness. Or you may rest. [Rinpoche lets out a deep breath.] You know, that is also looking for happiness. At that time try to remember to connect with the feeling of looking for happiness. Then you might look forward to doing some exercise, having lunch or dinner, doing some fun things, doing some art, or whatever. Connect with those feelings. All these feelings come from basic love — you want to be happier, you want to be free. And you can make the wish, \"May I have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" We should add \"the causes of happiness.\" This is really important. The real causes of happiness are being more connected with your basic goodness, awareness, love, compassion, wisdom — which already exist inside you. Then you become happier.&nbsp;So try to do that in your everyday life, okay?\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesThe wish to be happy is with you all the time and is expressed in whatever you are doing. At the start of each day, choose an activity or two that you are looking forward to. It could be having your morning coffee, attending choir practice, or meeting up with a friend. Whatever it is, see if you can notice the underlying wish to be happy that guides your desire to do this activity. Try to do this ten times throughout the week.Journal Reflection Questions\nHow does practicing in everyday life, specifically noticing all the times that you wish to be happy, compare to the formal meditation practice of wishing your past or future self well?&nbsp;\nDo you find it more helpful to engage in this practice formally or informally?

Welcome back. In this section, we are going to be meditating with love or loving-kindness towards oneself. What a beautiful thing! Just imagining that when we turn towards ourselves, what we see, what we connect with is this quality of love. This is the direction of the practice.&nbsp;\nI know that for myself, this has been a very rich area of practice, because I have not always held myself so kindly. The self-critic at times has been huge, and the feelings of unworthiness have also been huge. When I start looking towards basic goodness it can be like, \"Wow! Who do you think you are?\" or \"This is really selfish when the world needs something else right now.\" And yet, the more I touch into a sense of well-being within myself, the greater friendship I have with myself, the more capacity I have to be of service helping other beings. What I discovered is that really by coming to know my own suffering, the ways in which my habits of mind obstruct me from seeing this essential nature, the more capacity I have to be at home when others are struggling as well. So I find this a very rich area of practice, especially in the moments where it might be that I can open to and really receive this sense of the possibility of really flourishing in this life and to know the happiness that is before good and bad, a fundamental \"okayness\" and that I could really know this. I also find it really valuable when I am in these self-critical moments to not give up in these places, but just to keep looking and to know that this is a being that is struggling and can she know true happiness. Really, just a gentle wish at these times. So the practice includes a wide range of what arises as we practice, but just in that impulse of care, the impulse to do the practice, that this is an expression. And sometimes just resting in that motivation. I really look forward to hearing what you find as you meditate with love for oneself. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.2 Love for Oneself View\" data-href=\"2.1.2 Love for Oneself View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.2-love-for-oneself-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.2 Love For Oneself, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.2 love for oneself, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Love for Oneself (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Love_for_Oneself_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.2-love-for-oneself-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.2-love-for-oneself-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474674,"modifiedTime":1759272586218,"sourceSize":2570,"sourcePath":"1.

Last time, I gave you a practice in which you try to connect with your feeling of wanting to be happy. This is the same practice, but now we are going to build this meditation practice up step by step. There are a few different styles of meditation for this practice because of different personalities. Normally, we talk about three personalities: body, speech, and mind.\" People with the body personality use a lot of forms, shapes, colors, and imagine things. People with the speech personality use more phrases. Sometimes, we use phrases like, \"May I have happiness and the causes of happiness\". The mind personality is more connected to intuition and feelings. You feel connected with the feelings. Also, you can go back to your past memories about good feelings and that will help you enter into the feeling of looking for happiness. The variety here depends on what works best for you and your personality. Now, we are going to practice this together. Please keep your meditation posture. First, please rest your mind in open awareness for a while. Now, first, please ask yourself a question, \"What do I really want?\" When you ask this question, there are layers of feelings or thoughts of \"I want this, I want that.\" But keep asking. If you feel like, \"I cannot ask myself this question.\" that means that you want to ask that question. So, the feeling of looking for happiness is right there. You just need to recognize it. The desire of looking for happiness is with us 24 hours a day, and when we do not really connect with the deepest level of this feeling, if it stays at a conceptual level, many become very sensitive. It is easy for one to be happy, and also easy to be upset. There is a lot of judgment. But whatever feeling you have — all the thinking, thoughts, concepts, good, bad, or neutral — are all manifestations of innate love. You just want to be happy. You want to be happy with yourself, you want to be kind to yourself, and you want to care for yourself. You can now use the phrase, \"May I have happiness and the causes of happiness.\"Repeat these phrases again and again in your mind. If it t is helpful for you, you can do that. This phrase becomes a support for you to connect with your innate love. And if you feel like the phrase is not so easy, then there is no need to repeat the phrase. Okay. How do you feel? Normally, when we practice this innate love, we need to practice step by step and also, we have to start with the easy one. Most of the time, the instructions say that we should begin with ourselves. Sometimes, it is easy to begin with yourself because you have this feeling with you very strongly. Normally, the strongest feeling is with you, but the problem is that this innate love is filtered by our conceptual mind, the unhealthy sense of self, which is the ego-clinging phase. There is too much clinging. This clinging sometimes becomes like low self-esteem, also self-hatred. It is quite difficult for some people to practice with themselves at the beginning. But do not worry. The next step is with someone you like. Sometimes you can choose. You may begin with yourself and if it is very difficult, then begin with someone you like. You can alternate this. It is quite flexible. Do not worry about that, and this practice will be the next one. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice\nMeditating on Love for Oneself\nBegin session Begin by finding a comfortable posture.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice and recite the opening aspiration, or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest the mind into open awareness. Simply be present in this moment, allowing your experience to unfold naturally.&nbsp; Main practice Then, take a few moments to reflect on your own wish to be happy and how this wish motivates you in everything you do—even being here, right now, having the intention to meditate is indicative of this wish.&nbsp;\nAs you see and/or feel this wish present within you, cultivate the aspiration that you will flourish and know an easeful heart.\nNext, from this open-heartedness, begin to recite the phrase: \"May I have happiness and its causes.\" Connect with whatever aspect of experience is easiest—the words or a felt sense.&nbsp;\nRepeat the phrase as much as is helpful to remain connected to the practice.&nbsp;\nIf you get lost in thought or space out, just gently return to the phrases and continue reciting them.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the phrases and rest into open awareness.\nAs you conclude your practice, take a moment to reflect on how this practice can be of benefit, not only to yourself, but also to the world around you.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that might have come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. How did meditating on love for yourself go? Did bringing this into awareness change your experience?Do you connect more deeply with one of the three personality types—body, speech, or mind? If so, are there particular strategies that help you to connect with the fundamental wish to be happy?Did you experiment with using phrases such as \"May I be happy and have the causes of happiness\"? If so, how was your experience?

No matter who you are or which day it is, you have it 24 hours a day, even when you feel hatred. I was teaching all these things, and it looked like everybody was very happy. I was very happy too. After I finished the talk, I went out. One man was waiting for me outside, and he said, \"Excuse me, can I talk to you?\" and I said, \"Yes.\" He told me, \"Your story, your idea, your teaching about everybody having this love is wonderful. I like it, but I just want to let you know that I do not have that. Maybe they have love all the time, but I hate myself all the time.\" I listened to him, and then I ask him, \"Why did you come here?\" The man told me, \"Oh, I want to learn something for you.\" And I asked him, \"Why do you want to learn from me?\" And he said, \"Oh, I want to be free from the feeling of hatred. This is why I came to you, so I can free this feeling, so I can be happy.\" Then I told him, \"Actually, you care for yourself. You want to be free from this hatred and you want to be happy. You came all this way. You came from far away, took the time, and made the effort of this journey. It is not so easy, right?\" Then this person said, \"Oh yeah, you are right.\" Although sometimes we feel like we hate ourselves, and sometimes we feel like, \"Oh, I am useless, not good enough, many people do not like me,\" that is normal. Even though you have these feelings, on a deeper level all these feelings are, actually, coming out of love. The first practice is that we need to connect with our fundamental feeling of love. How to do that? For this, there are five steps. The first is that we are going to practice and connect with our fundamental feeling of love beginning with ourselves. Then slowly, someone you like. Then a neutral person. Then someone whom you hate. Then all beings. We have to practice this step by step. We say that first, you need to understand your own feelings and motivation. Of course, when we first do this, what we experience is that we only see the surface level. There are a lot of unpleasant concepts, including self-hatred and concepts about what we normally call the \"fixed mind.\" When I was young, I had this panic. Our mind is so much attached to one single idea, and we do not want to let go, and we are too tight with that idea. Because our mind becomes too tight, there is a lot of stress, panic, feelings of depression and hatred — and all this comes. Then that is okay, we are just aware and aware, and we can go deeper into the feeling. On a deeper level, we just want to be free and happy. Unconditional love is with you all the time. We need to connect with that. In our next session, we need to practice this — to connect with our fundamental love.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche highlights how even feelings of self-hatred are expressions of your true nature and your wish to be happy.

The homework for this is when you go back to normal life, whatever you do — you may be working at a company, or doing some research, or doing exercise, or interacting with people, or anything — you have to remember that whenever you see a person, a being, animal, or whoever, if you like them, you can connect with those people. Here, we are putting the emphasis first in someone whom you like. If you go to your workplace, if you look at someone you hate, do not begin with that one. If you start with those people, you may feel the hatred increase. You may feel like: \"Gosh, I am not a good meditator,\" and you will feel disappointed. Therefore, start with someone whom you like, someone that inspires you, even a puppy or a cat. When you interact with them, and when you see them, you can understand that they are the same as you. You can wish them to have happiness and the causes of happiness. You can do it silently — a little sending practice. You can take a deep breath in, then breathe out, and send your love, happiness, and compassion to them. \"May he or she have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" And look at them with a smile. Try that. Maybe even for a few seconds only. It is not necessary to be very long. Or if you just walk into a crowd, you can see whomever you feel is nice, and then apply this to them. Or look at nature, maybe you can find birds. Look at the sky, at the birds that are flying. Or on the television, if you see someone nice — a person or being — on the TV, you can practice with them. Do that in your everyday life. And if you want to set a goal like, \"I will do it ten times,\" if that works for you, that is great! Or you can use the reminders on an App. Or you can use some particular sign for yourself as a reminder of this practice of love.

Based on this softness and care that we generate and feel for ourselves, we are going to extend this warmth and this softness towards someone we care for. Mingyur Rinpoche, when he introduces us to this practice, often mentions puppies, because it is true that when we all think about a puppy, we immediately feel some kind of joy and warmth. The only thing we want for this puppy is happiness. We try to feed this puppy as much as it needs, we try to care for it, and we try to play with this puppy. So, for me, what really worked best was just thinking about someone I have no issue at all with and for whom I can immediately feel warmth, care, kindness, and love without any questions. Once I found this person to nourish my practice, I just use the feeling that this person gave me to start doing this meditation for a loved one. For me, the care I have for this person is the expression of my wish for him or her to be happy. And this is exactly what we are trying to nourish — the love we are able to feel for ourselves, but also the love we are able to feel for our loved ones. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.3 Love for a Loved One View\" data-href=\"2.1.3 Love for a Loved One View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.3-love-for-a-loved-one-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.3 Love For A Loved One, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.3 love for a loved one, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Love for a Loved One (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Love_for_a_Loved_One_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.3-love-for-a-loved-one-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.3-love-for-a-loved-one-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474600,"modifiedTime":1759272586258,"sourceSize":1906,"sourcePath":"1.

For this practice, you have to think of that being. It could be anyone — your grandma, a puppy, anyone. Then, feeling that this person is just like you, looking for happiness all the time. Then, the main practice is to understand their feeling of looking for happiness and wish that they be happy and have the causes of happiness. The causes of happiness are not always what we think they are. If someone is angry and harms others, it may seem to make them feel happy, but that is not a real cause of happiness. If a thief manages to steal something, it may seem like the thief will be happy, but that is not a real cause for genuine happiness. So here, you just wish that this being is really connected with genuine happiness and the causes of happiness. For this, you can choose — depending on your personality — a different method depending on what makes you happy. You can use a phrase like, \"May he or she have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" You can label it. Or you can just feel or wish that they become happier. Or you can imagine that you are giving or sending them happiness so they become happier. In order to do that, there is a traditional practice of \"taking and sending.\" Here, we will do the \"sending practice.\" You can combine it with your breathing. When you breathe out, send your love, compassion, and happiness to that person and wish that thit person have happiness and the causes of happiness. You can do that including an imagination. You can do it only with the phrase. You can just feel that they have happiness and the causes of happiness. It depends on you. Now, let's try this together. First, keep your meditation posture, relax the muscles in your body, and be in open awareness meditation. [Silent meditation] Now, think of the person whom you like, in your mind. And try to understand that that being is the same as you, looking for happiness 24/7, with every movement and every breath. Now, you can wish, \"May you have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" [Silent meditation] Now you can breathe in, and when you breathe out, you can send your love, compassion, and happiness to him or her. [Silent meditation] Now, rest your mind in open awareness again. [Silent meditation] Okay. 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice\nMeditating on Love for a Loved One\nBegin session Settle into a comfortable posture and take a few deep, calming breaths.&nbsp;\nTo begin, rest the mind in open awareness. Just drop all effort, and let the mind rest as it is.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or finding your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Now, bring to mind a loved one. You could imagine that this person is here with you. You could imagine shaking their hand or giving them a hug—something that brings to mind the connection you share with them.&nbsp;\nReflect on how this person, just like you, wants to be happy and experience well-being. See whether you can notice this desire. If it helps, think of some of the things they do in their life to express this desire to be happy.&nbsp;\nIn seeing their desire to be happy and flourish more clearly, you are seeing the essence of love. This is part of their nature. This is part of your nature.&nbsp;\nOnce you have connected with their wish to be happy, repeat this phrase: \"May you have happiness and its causes.\"&nbsp;\nAs you repeat this phrase silently in your mind, extend your own love and care to this person. Notice how you naturally want this person to be happy and to flourish.&nbsp;\nNow, drop all the doing, and simply be, letting the mind rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nOnce again, bring this person to mind. Feel the sense of warmth and connection that you share. Notice how, just like you, this person wants to be happy. And, not only that, you each want the other to be happy. This is the basis of the connection that you have.&nbsp;\nAs you breathe out, imagine that you are sending them all the happiness in the world; all the good things that exist in the world. Imagine sending it out with each exhalation.&nbsp;\nIf it helps, you can imagine a bright white light radiating out from you with each exhalation and being absorbed into your loved one.&nbsp; End session Now, for the last few moments, allow your mind to rest in open awareness. Just be. If your eyes are closed, slowly open them and take in this moment with a sense of appreciation.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you practice love for a loved one, which of the three approaches is most useful: using the phrases, feeling the love directly, or imagining the well-being of another?How does this practice differ from meditating on love for yourself? Do you find it more or less difficult?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.3 Love for a Loved One Application\" data-href=\"2.1.3 Love for a Loved One Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.3-love-for-a-loved-one-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.3 Love For A Loved One, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.3 love for a loved one, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.3 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Loved for a Loved One: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Loved_for_a_Loved_One_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love for a Loved One: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_for_a_Loved_One_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.3-love-for-a-loved-one-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.3-love-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474584,"modifiedTime":1759272586266,"sourceSize":6424,"sourcePath":"1.

Because it is a step by step practice: so, first, you have to recognize within yourself that you are looking for happiness in every moment, every breath, every second. Of course, if our minds are too tight with that, then we become very sensitive. It is easy to laugh, cry, disappear, burn, bloom, freeze, etc. As I mentioned before, you may say you are fine when someone asks how you are, but inside, you may feel you want to cry. You have to understand this basic feeling with yourself, and then you need to expand it to others. But first, you need to choose someone whom you like. Normally, we say that we have to begin any meditation practice with the easiest step. Some people think, \"Oh, everybody has love and compassion. I have this feeling, and everyone else has it, too. So why can I not feel this feeling of love and compassion? I should feel it because it is there, but I cannot. Maybe I am not good, or maybe I am stupid.\" Some people think that, but that is not the case. We have to learn everything step by step. When you want to grow a flower, at first it is just a seed. You plant the seed, you need to fertilize it, water it, and wait — and it will slowly grow. Although love and compassion are with us all the time, it is not so easy to connect with them. We have to practice step by step. Therefore, for the second step, you need to choose someone whom you like. I did this practice when I was young. At first, I could not find a person I liked, and I had to think about with whom I should practice. I chose my grandma. I loved my grandma. She was so nice, and she took care of me. When I thought of her, it really helped me to connect with love. Later, I found that I actually had a lot of this feeling — not only for my grandma but also for my mom and my grandpa. Of course, I had a strong feeling of love for my father. When I was with them, I did not feel it that much, but when I was away — when I went to India, and my family was in Nepal — I missed them. I thought, \"Oh, they are kind. They are compassionate.\" Sometimes, if it is very close to you, you cannot see it. Therefore, we have to practice step by step. In order to practice this step, first, you need to find someone you like. But if you cannot find someone who is close to you, you can think of someone you feel inspired by — maybe a star, your idol, your source of inspiration. Whether they are directly connected with you or not does not matter. The important thing is that they are just like you. They want to be happy — every moment, with every movement, and every eyeblink. But whether we can get the right causes of happiness or not is the issue. We want to be happy, but we may not know the causes of happiness. So that is the issue. Still, we are all looking for happiness. You need to understand this with your close ones.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nIf the basic wish to be happy is with us all the time, why is it that we are not happy?

You need to choose one particular event or situation in which you encounter people you do not know. You may go to a public place, the beach, outdoors, or to a shopping center. You need to interact. If you are in a remote area, maybe you can practice with somebody you see in the news or on your phone. That is also okay. You need to choose a particular situation or event and apply the practice with the beings you encounter there. The main practice is the same. Try to understand that they are the same as you — they wish to be happy. At the same time, this feeling is with them — love — though they may not recognize it. Whether they recognize it or not, whether they believe this or not, love is with all of us, and you need to connect with that from your point of view. Love is always there. Even though you cannot see it, even though it is not tangible, love is very strong. It is there. You have to try this in the next day or so. And next time, I will give you an examination.

Welcome back. Here we are, entering a new section, a new landscape. Today we are going to be looking towards meditating with a neutral person. I actually find myself a little bit excited about this one, because the learning has been quite rich in this area in a number of different ways. One thing was looking around and realizing just how many neutral people there are in the world, and then realizing, \"Oh my goodness, these are people that I do not usually even see.\" In some way, there was not that connection to see that these are human beings, just like me, who also want to be happy and flourish in their lives. It just opened up the horizon of who is in this world that I share this life with, and being able to tap into a sense of them being just like me. I know that for other people it is quite different. I have heard people say, \"There is nobody who is neutral. There is nobody whom I do not experience some attachment or aversion towards.\" I think this, in itself, is insightful, too. And it is fine. So we just find somebody who is relatively neutral. Along with working with a neutral person, something else really came to light for me. There was a time when I was practicing using the same person in many meditation sessions over a period of days, and what I started to notice was that this person went from being a neutral person to being someone I started to feel affection for. Then they turned up with a cast on their leg, and I was so concerned about them. What I realized was that not only had my affection for them grown in that time but that there had been nothing in their behavior that had changed. It was not like there was somebody who changed their ways and that now I could really open my heart to them. Rather, it was just seeing that what had shifted was the relationship to them in my own mind. I find this to be a very, very valuable way of practicing and a way of really opening my heart to the world in a bigger way. Let's see what you find out as you practice with a neutral person. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.4 Love for a Neutral Person View\" data-href=\"2.1.4 Love for a Neutral Person View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.4 Love For A Neutral Person, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.4 love for a neutral person, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Love for a Neutral Person (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Love_for_a_Neutral_Person_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474566,"modifiedTime":1759272586303,"sourceSize":2705,"sourcePath":"1.

Maybe you go shopping every day, and you find a cashier or a person there whom you do not particularly like or hate. Maybe you have some colleagues whom you do not know or colleagues who are your friends, but not really close friends. Or it could be the postman or whomever. Or maybe, if you cannot find someone, just pick a person from the street whom you connected with this morning or while you were on the way to your job. With the technique or practice, it is the same thing. Love is the wish to be free, to have happiness. The main aspect of love is the wish to be happy. We talked about the causes of happiness. Remember that the cause of happiness is to connect with love, compassion, awareness, and wisdom. All these things are inside you. The more you connect with your fundamental qualities, the happier you will become. For example, normally we have this egoistic mind. You have to win. You have to be the best. You have to achieve everything. You need to be first. But no matter how successful we are, we do not feel real satisfaction. We do not feel really happy deep within. But if you help others or try to do some social work, then you really feel happy from within. Genuinely happy. The more you connect with your true nature, your fundamental quality, the happier you will be. Now, we are going to expand this love and compassion. The object is not only you. To expand, we already practiced with someone you like, and now we will practice with someone you do not know. Please keep your meditation posture, and first rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, think of a neutral person in your mind. That person or animal is the same as you, looking for happiness in every moment, every breath, and every blink of the eyes. [Silent meditation] And wish, \"May you have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" [Silent meditation] Send your love and compassion to that being. You can use your breath. [Silent meditation] Okay. Now, please rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay. How was it? Can you do it or is it difficult? Normally, many people say, \"Oh, I cannot feel it. I need to have the feeling of love.\" But actually, the moment you try to feel this love, that is the feeling. The feeling is right there. This is what we sometimes call \"zero love.\" \"Zero percent love\" is more important than the feeling of love. That means the intention to feel love for others is more important than some experience or feeling of love. This is because the feeling of love goes up and down, and up and down, especially if you look for this strong feeling because the feeling normally changes. But the underlying basis for this feeling, the genuine love, never changes. It is always there. But sometimes we take it for granted. It is always there and so available that we cannot see it. Therefore, what I sometimes call \"zero percent love\" is the moment when you want to develop love and then try to do it. That is all. Do not worry about the quality. Whether you feel it or not does not matter. 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice\nMeditating on Love for a Neutral Person\nBegin session Begin by taking a deep breath and settling into a comfortable posture.\nRest in open awareness, letting everything be just as it is for a few moments.&nbsp;\nAs you rest in open awareness, reflect on your motivation to engage in this practice. Then, either using the opening aspiration or finding your own words, give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Next, bring to mind someone who is a neutral person—someone whom you don't have strong attachment or aversion to. Examples include a bus driver or attendant at the grocery store. You can focus either on the image of this person or the felt sense.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on how you wish to be happy and have well-being. Even though you may not know anything about this person, they share in this basic wish to be happy and have well-being.\nThen, as you hold this person in your mind, gently offer the phrase: \"May you have happiness and its causes.\" Recite this phrase as much as is supportive.&nbsp;\nUse the phrases to help you to connect with the quality of love for this neutral person.&nbsp;\nIf you start to feel restless or agitated, just rest in open awareness for a few moments. Once you are composed, simply return to the neutral person and continue reciting the phrases.&nbsp;\nRemember, you can always return to the basic fact that this person shares in the fundamental wish to be happy and have well-being.&nbsp; End session Let go of the phrases and rest in open awareness.\nAs you conclude, take a moment to reflect on how this practice can benefit all beings everywhere. Using the closing dedication or finding your own words, dedicate any positivity that might have come from this practice. When you cultivate the wish for your neutral person to be happy and free from suffering, what is your experience like?Do you agree with Mingyur Rinpoche's explanation that these practices of meditating on love for others can help lessen the egoistic mind? If so, how do they do this? If not, what alternatives do you find to be most effective?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.4 Love for a Neutral Person Application\" data-href=\"2.1.4 Love for a Neutral Person Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.4 Love For A Neutral Person, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.4 love for a neutral person, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Love for a Neutral Person: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Love_for_a_Neutral_Person_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love for a Neutral Person: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_for_a_Neutral_Person_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474561,"modifiedTime":1759272586315,"sourceSize":6762,"sourcePath":"1.

Step by step, we are becoming more and more advanced. Once you understand what your basic feeling is for yourself, you can then practice with regard to someone whom you like and with whom you feel some connection. Next, you can practice with regard to someone whom you do not know. The percentage of neutral people you encounter in your life is high. Most people are people we do not know. They are not people you hate, and they are not people you love, but just people whom you do not know. This is a great opportunity to open our hearts and connect with all beings — many, many people. In order to do that, you first have to choose one or two people. You have to think of people whom you do not know, and you need to feel that they have this love and that they are looking for happiness, just like you, every day, 24/7 — with every movement, eyeblink, and every breath.\nIn general, most people are good — good at heart — but normally we do not see that. What we see are only the negative aspects. In Nepal, a few years back, there were a lot of problems — political problems, big problems. We did not have water, electricity, or gas. On the television, there was a lot of bad news. When a lot of bad news comes, we tend to think, \"Oh yeah, it is always the same,\" and not many people pay attention to it. But these days, in Nepal, it is getting to be quite good. I really love my country, and now there is water, electricity, and gas. Once in a while, there is bad news on the TV, and everybody really pays attention while they are drinking their coffee. And when the bad news comes, they are like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to gape at a television.] Why is that? Because now bad news has become uncommon. So, in the world, when we see the \"Breaking News\" and everyone pays attention, that is actually a good sign. Actually, the world is getting better. I have heard some of my scientist friends say that nowadays we have the lowest violence rate in all of human history. But we do not feel that. What we see is that the world is getting worse every day. Normally, if you have ten qualities, and nine are positive and one is negative, you only see the negative one. We ignore the nine positive qualities within ourselves. Further, we exaggerate the one negative quality within ourselves, within others, and within the whole world. So now, try to connect with all beings. They possess genuine love, and they try their best to do something good, to be someone nice. They want happiness for themselves and for others. It is really important to understand that. Once you do understand that, then you feel a connection. All of a sudden, you feel like they have become part of you, like family. When I went on the wandering retreat, I ended up in a train station where there was nothing. I just sat on the ground at the station. Looking around, I felt very strange. I felt a little bit insecure and lonely. Then I began to practice with someone I did not know. There was a woman who was there with her family and they were also sitting on the ground. So I practiced by thinking: \"They are also like me. They are looking for happiness.\" And I did the practice of sending love. The next morning, when I looked at them, they had become much nicer than the day before. They were the same people, but I felt like they were kinder and warmer, and I began to communicate with them — they looked very nice (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs). So, changing is possible. This practice is really powerful.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the expression of the true nature of all beings—including those you know and those you don't—is the wish for happiness. He also explains that this fact can be difficult to remember. Why is this?\nPoints to remember:\nThe next step in the practice of love is to expand it to include neutral people.&nbsp;\nPracticing love for a neutral person involves recognizing their wish to be happy.\nPeople tend to focus on the negative, as is illustrated through Mingyur Rinpoche's story about his home country of Nepal.\nThrough meditating on love for neutral people, there can be demonstrable shifts in how people relate to you.\nTip\nFocusing on the good qualities of others will have an impact on how you experience them.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nthe basics of exchanging self and other\nhow to use afflictive emotions while meditating on love for others\nabout the nature of suffering The Joy of Living, pp. 185-186 (Ch. 13, \"Level One\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.4 Love for a Neutral Person Meditation\" data-href=\"2.1.4 Love for a Neutral Person Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.4 Love For A Neutral Person, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.4 love for a neutral person, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Love for a Neutral Person: View (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Love_for_a_Neutral_Person_View_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love for a Neutral Person: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_for_a_Neutral_Person_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(10_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.4-love-for-a-neutral-person-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474552,"modifiedTime":1759272586330,"sourceSize":5773,"sourcePath":"1.

You have to work with a difficult person, such as someone at your workplace. Of course, you can find a difficult person in the workplace or sometimes in your family. Maybe sometimes you hate someone a lot, even if, at the same time, you like them a lot. So, again, if you cannot work with a very difficult person, maybe you can work with a mildly difficult person. Normally, when I teach this, someone has a story about having meetings at their workplace. Every time this person has to go to a meeting with this other person, they get tense and think, \"Gosh, I have to have a meeting with that person again.\" And they just hate it. And then this person tries to practice, thinking, \"I hate that person, but maybe they are somebody's best friend. So, if I were that person's best friend, how would I view them?\" Try to change your perspective. Do some meditation practice, and then you will see when you go to meet that person, that it completely changes the perspective. That person looks much better, and there is a feeling of connection. So, actually, it really helps. You can try to do that. Otherwise, what we normally do is thinking, \"This person is not good. They are making obstacles in my life. They always irritate me.\" Sometimes we feel like getting revenge. \"I said something, and the next day he did something to me, and I thought, 'Just you wait!'\" So you retaliate and go back and forth, and then slowly, slowly, you two become big enemies. In the end, you make even more enemies. We say that you cannot defeat your enemies with hatred. You can defeat your enemies with compassion. If an enemy becomes your friend, then there is no enemy, right? There is a traditional story about how in ancient times, there were no shoes, so people walked barefoot. Then one person thought, \"What should I do about this?\" And he thought, \"Maybe I can cover the whole road with leather.\" So he cut some leather and covered the road. But that person had to walk many kilometers, but the leather did not last that far. So he still had to walk barefoot. Then, that person kept thinking and thinking... What do you think is the best solution?\nThink… Should I tell you? I think the best solution is to cover your feet with just two small pieces of leather. If you do not know how to make shoes, just cover them. If you cover your feet with leather, then, for you, it is the same as if you had covered the entire world with leather, right? If you want to cover the entire world with leather, it is impossible. Even if you could do that, it would not be beautiful. It would be ugly, right? (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs) If you free yourself, you can actually really transform the people around you, and you will find more friends than enemies. This is really important, so I want you to do this practice. And remember the examination. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesUndoubtedly, there are people in your life whom you find difficult. They could be coworkers, family members, or someone else. Over the next few days, choose one of these people as the object of your love. When you encounter them, or when they come to mind, try to cultivate the wish for them to be happy and to have the causes of happiness. If it is helpful, reflect on the fact that they are probably someone else's best friend, and recognize the circumstances that cause them to act unskillfully toward you. See if you can cultivate this wish ten times each day.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhy did you choose the person you chose? Do they harm you? Annoy you? Frustrate you? If so, what do you think causes them to act in this way?&nbsp;\nAre you able to see that it is the ignorance and negative emotions of others that cause them to act in harmful ways?\nAs you engage in this step-by-step process of cultivating love for others, do you find that it is getting easier?

If not, why not?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.5 Love for a Difficult Person Summary\" data-href=\"2.1.5 Love for a Difficult Person Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.5-love-for-a-difficult-person-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.5 Love For A Difficult Person, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.5 love for a difficult person, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.5 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love for a Difficult Person: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_for_a_Difficult_Person_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.5-love-for-a-difficult-person-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.5-love-for-a-difficult-person-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474544,"modifiedTime":1759272586346,"sourceSize":5018,"sourcePath":"1.

For me, this practice has been very efficient, and even though it was not a very easy practice, it was a very beneficial practice for myself and for my surroundings.\nOf course, when we think about a difficult person, the first idea we have is not to practice love and compassion for them. The first idea we have is just to go away from them. So, in the beginning, I would say I started to practice love for a difficult person, but I had the feeling of faking it a little bit because I was saying, \"May this person I have difficulties with be happy, but away from me.\" Of course, I had this kind of strange feeling of not being completely honest, but at least I knew I was a little bit far away from the goal. Slowly, slowly, I realized that the point was not to be able to feel love for this difficult person, but more to be able to include this person in the expression of my love, in the expression of all the qualities of my basic goodness. For me, the benefit of this practice was that slowly, slowly, the people I thought I had difficulties with were not so difficult anymore. It was not such a big deal. Of course, some difficulties were still there, but it was not a big deal anymore. Thanks to the confidence I gained in my practice, in my awareness practice, and in my basic goodness, I was finally able to include them in the realm of the expression of my love. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.5 Love for a Difficult Person View\" data-href=\"2.1.5 Love for a Difficult Person View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.5-love-for-a-difficult-person-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.5 Love For A Difficult Person, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.5 love for a difficult person, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.5 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Love for a Difficult Person","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Love_for_a_Difficult_Person_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.5-love-for-a-difficult-person-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.5-love-for-a-difficult-person-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474536,"modifiedTime":1759272586352,"sourceSize":2154,"sourcePath":"1.

This practice is really interesting, and normally, it is quite difficult. But even if you only do this practice for a very short time, there will be a lot of benefits. Now, we are going to practice this together. If you cannot meditate with a particular difficult person because you hate that person a lot, then do not choose a person who brings up a lot of strong emotions, at the beginning. Maybe you can choose a mildly difficult person whom you simply do not like. Of course, we have to do this gradually, step by step. If you feel like you cannot practice this with the person you already chose because, suddenly, a strong emotion comes, then you have to change the person. Maybe you can go back to a neutral person or someone you like. You have to do it gradually, okay? Now, please keep your meditation posture and rest your mind as it is, in open awareness. Just be, and do not worry about whether you are doing it right or wrong. As long as you try to just be, you are being. [Silent meditation] Now, think of the difficult person in your mind. That person is the same as you, wishing for happiness all the time. That person's basic nature is good. That person has awareness 24 hours a day as well as love. But they may not recognize the love and awareness that is within him or her. Out of ignorance comes a lot of negative emotions, such as hatred, and once this negative emotion comes, it gets out of control. Even if you do not want to hate, your hatred gets out of control. That makes other people, the people around you, unhappy, and eventually, it makes you unhappy also. Now wish, \"May you have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" What are the causes of happiness? The causes of happiness are to connect with genuine love within and to be free from negative emotions. And you can use phrases. You can use your breathing. [Silent meditation] \"May you have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" [Silent meditation] Okay. Now, rest in open awareness again. [Silent meditation] Okay. 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nMeditating on Love for a Difficult Person\nBegin session Begin by checking your posture. Take a few calming breaths. Notice what the air feels like moving in and out of your body.&nbsp;\nNext, let go of the breath and rest in open awareness. Let go of any sense of doing, and give yourself permission to rest, right here in the present moment.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Next, bring to mind someone who is a difficult person for you. You can focus either on the image of this person or the felt sense.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on how you wish to be happy and have well-being. Even though this person may annoy you or make your life difficult in some way, they share in this basic wish to be happy and have well-being.\nThen, as you hold this person in your mind, gently offer the phrase: \"May you have happiness and its causes.\" Recite this phrase as much as is supportive.&nbsp;\nYou may feel resistance to this practice. Remember, simply having the intention to engage in this practice is transformative.&nbsp;\nYou could imagine that this person is a parent, a child, a partner, and a loved one to many others. This can help bridge the gap you may feel. Remember, this person wants to be happy just like you.&nbsp;\nAs is helpful, feel free to take a break from the practice and rest the mind in effortless, open awareness. After a few moments, once again bring to mind a person you find difficult, and continue the practice.&nbsp;\nAs an alternative, you can pair this practice with the inhalation and exhalation of the breath. For example, on the out-breath, imagine that white light—filled with love and happiness—comes forth and fills the person you are envisioning with happiness and well-being. End session Let go of the exercise. If your eyes were closed, you can now open them and rest the mind in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. What is your experience like when meditating on love for a difficult person? Are you able to see the similarities between them and yourself? Explain how this unfolds.Mingyur Rinpoche says that there is a great deal of benefit from this style of meditation, even when practiced for a short period. Why do you think this is the case?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

So, first, it is with ourselves, then with someone you like, and a neutral person, someone you do not particularly like or hate. So we are gradually expanding our love to others. The most difficult thing for us is with someone we do not like. Maybe I will tell you a story, a true story. When I was young, I was with my father in Nepal, on a mountain. Normally, many people came to receive meditation instructions from my father, my father's name was Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, and people came from all over the world. They came there, at the nunnery in Nepal, and they received teachings from my father. And, one time, a group of people came and they were receiving teachings from my father and there were two men that did not like each other, and some days they were fighting. One night, they were fighting a lot. My father and I were having noodles for dinner, what we in Tibetan call, \"thukpa\". And suddenly a man showed up in the room, and he was very angry. Then, he asked my father, \"Please, can you teach me how to control my hatred? I just fought another man and we beat each other\". And my father said \"Okay, yeah\", while he was having soup, he was listening. And then my father asked him a question, \"Why do you hate that person?\" And the man said, \"Oh, because that person is not good, that person said bad things about me, that person hit me, brought a lot of problems to me\". Then my father said, \"Oh yeah. So, because that person really hates you, you hate that person. But, actually, the one who hit you really is the stick or the words of that person. So maybe you should hate the stick and the words of that person instead.\" And the man said \"Ha ha ha, this is stupid logic, it does not help me. I have tried to think about those things, but I am not stupid. The stick is controlled by him. The words are controlled by him. Words are just words. I hate him, not the stick.\" And my father said \"Oh yeah. Then, in that case, maybe you should hate the negative emotion within that person, because that person is controlled by hatred, anger, ignorance, jealousy, or whatever that person has. So, maybe you should hate the emotion within that person.\" And then the man said, \"Oh, yeah. I never thought of that before.\" And he kind of changed his face and began to calm down and try to listen more to my father. And my father continued saying, \"Do you want to hate that person?\", and he said, \"No, I do not want to hate that person. That is why I came here, to receive advice from you\". My father said, \"It might be that the other person feels the same way: the other person does not want to hate, but when the hatred comes, he cannot control himself, he is out of control\". Like when we face certain situations, our emotions go out of control, even if we do not like them to. Maybe you do not want to hate, you do not want to be angry, you do now want to be jealous, you do not want to have ignorance, right? You do not want confusion. But when these come, there is no control. Even if you think of the worst person in the world, and you do not like this person. For you, this person is really bad, but some other people look at that person, and they might see that person as their best friend, or the kindest person in the world. Therefore, the really important thing here is that when we have these negative emotions, we cannot control them. So, it is the same for you, and for me as well, but deep within, all of us want to be happy, all of us want to be free from problems. We do not want to make mistakes. We do not want to do unvirtuous things that bring harm to others. This is really important to understand. And maybe I would like to ask you a question. You might have a difficult person, right? Do you or do you not? If you do not have this you cannot practice this meditation. So, first, you make one, and then you can practice this. No, I am just kidding. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] Everybody has someone they do not like, maybe your colleagues at your workplace, maybe you do not like your boss, or maybe you do not like the staff, or maybe you do not like a political leader from some country, or maybe you turn on the television and then you see bad news or a bad person. So we all have things that we do not like. Let's say you have the worst person, that you really hate, at your workplace, if that person really develops love, compassion, and awareness, if that person is free from this hatred and begins to care about others, including you, of course, everybody, will you be happy or not? If yes, raise your hand. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] Normally I ask this question and everybody says \"yes\". So that is what we need to practice now, for this meditation. And we will do this meditation practice in the next section.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nPut yourself in the shoes of Mingyur Rinpoche's father's student—the person overcome with anger towards another community member.

When you wake up, the first thing you can do is try to remember, \"Okay, today, whatever I do — all the virtues things like meditation, helping others, doing some social work, even smiling at someone, etc. — whatever virtue I practice, may that become causes of benefit to all beings.\" Try to develop this motivation in the morning. You can go to your work and look at the people around you, whomever you may see. The person whom you like, hate, or is neutral, see that within them, there is this basic innate goodness — the love. You can feel that, and try to be nice to them; help them however you can, even just a smile or a nice conversation. And, at the same time, whatever you can do to bring about the causes to benefit everybody. One important thing nowadays is that we are having the problem of global warming. There are problems with the environment, and it makes everyone suffer around the world. Of course, you cannot suddenly change the entire world, but you are part of this earth and you can do whatever you can. You can take care of the environment around you. Whatever contribution you can do, like planting a tree, or cleaning the garbage, doing recycling, whatever you can do, do it with the intention: \"May this be of benefit to all beings.\" Try to practice this.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesWhen you wake up in the morning, cultivate the intention that everything you do throughout the day will serve to benefit others.

Here we are in our final section of meditating with love or loving-kindness. In this section what we are meditating with is loving-kindness for all living beings. And this really opens up our hearts to the immensity, innumerable, limitless number of beings that there are. We began in a way with those who are near and dear to us and then gradually moved out to become more inclusive. This takes us well beyond our preferences, beyond our likes and dislikes, to all living beings, all forms of life, and to all different levels of existence. As always, I find that there are things that I learn with each of these different categories or landscapes as I see them. For me, something that happened as I was practicing with loving-kindness for all living beings was realizing that I had been doing it for a number of years, with \"all living beings\" beginning at the edge of my skin. Meaning that I was not a part of all living beings, and there was something there that was radically reorienting when I allowed myself to be part of all living beings. This is something that I have found immensely helpful and beneficial when I travel. I travel quite a bit for work, and I find myself in foreign lands where I might not speak the language. So, this is a practice that I do walking down the street and it really helps me, not only to open my heart to other beings, but it also helps me to feel like being a part of wherever I am. There is nothing that is separate, there is nothing isolated, and it just brings great joy to my heart when I experience this.In doing this as a formal practice I find there are some interesting pieces to it. At times, especially when I am low in energy, just the sense of having this wish in my heart that all beings can be happy, that they can know a deep sense of wellbeing, that they can flourish in their lives, just having this sense of radiating out from my heart feels really simple and easy and kind of natural on a certain level. I know there are times when this can feel abstract. Who are all beings? Where are they? And then I realize I need to have a little bit more, something that my imagination can work with more concretely in a sense. That is where I found it really helpful doing things like beginning with oneself, then people that one is near and dear to, and gradually moving that out. It feels to me like a practice that I do differently at different times, according to what helps me to connect. I know for some people this is a challenging category because it feels abstract at times. For other people, it will just feel really easy because we do not have all these individuals that we call to mind, and then suddenly we remember all the things we either like or do not like about this person. And so it is freeing on that level. Anyhow, it is a joy to work with and it is a practice when walking down the street, it really lends itself to this as a way of just connecting with the beings that are there and a way of being part of the whole. So, I look forward to hearing what you discover as you venture into this landscape. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.6 Love for All Beings View\" data-href=\"2.1.6 Love for All Beings View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.6-love-for-all-beings-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.6 Love For All Beings, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.6 love for all beings, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.6 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Love for All Beings (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Love_for_All_Beings_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.6-love-for-all-beings-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.6-love-for-all-beings-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474499,"modifiedTime":1759272586390,"sourceSize":3769,"sourcePath":"1.

Of course, sometimes we want to meditate with all beings, which is quite difficult, so maybe we can do a slow expansion. You can start with the people around you, your family, or your dog, then the birds flying around you, then your neighbors, your village or town, and your country. Then you can expand it to include the earth and all beings, whatever beings are out there. We are going to expand like that, okay? So first, please keep your meditation posture and rest your mind as it is. [Silent meditation.] Now, connect with the feeling that all beings have the wish to be happy just like you, no matter who they are, or where they live. Think about the beings around you, right now — your friends, family, and neighbors. They all want to be happy, just like you. And then, send your love, expand it outward to your town or city. It does not matter what culture it is. It does not matter what they do. It does not matter where they work, where they go; they are all looking for happiness. And then, expand it, even more, to include all of the beings in your country. All of these beings want to be happy, and they are worthy of being happy — their true nature is great! Now, expand it even more, to include the entire world. All beings in this world want to be happy, and they are worthy of being happy; they have this great nature. Now, expand it to include the entire universe, to all of the beings that are out there. \"May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" You can use a phrase, your imagination, or you can just feel it. The beings out there are just like you; we all possess this wonderful nature. And the sign of this wonderful nature is the feeling of the wish to be happy. So wish that all beings may return to their true homes. \"May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" And you can do the breathing exercise — take a deep breath in, and when you breathe out, send your love and compassion to all beings. Send your happiness to all beings. Now, please rest your mind in open awareness — open awareness that is infused with immeasurable love. [Silent meditation.] Okay. 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nMeditating on Love for All Beings\nBegin session First, settle into a comfortable posture and then rest in open awareness, right here in the present moment.&nbsp;\nAs you begin, cultivate a motivation that is imbued with care and love for all beings. Using the opening aspiration or finding your own words, give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind different types of living beings. These include individuals who are near and dear to you, your acquaintances, your enemies, animals, insects, and all the diverse forms of life. In whatever way works for you, cultivate a sense of connection with these beings.&nbsp;\nRemember that all beings—no matter where they are—share in the wish to be happy and have well-being.&nbsp;\nNext, recite the phrase: \"May all beings be happy and have the causes of happiness.\" Imbue your recitation with a sense of care for all beings.&nbsp;\nIf it is helpful, you can use the outbreath to connect with the feeling of sending out this simple wish to all living beings everywhere.&nbsp;\nUse the phrases as often as is helpful to connect with a sense of sending out love to all beings.&nbsp;\nYou can also begin the practice with yourself and then gradually extend the wish for happiness to other beings.&nbsp;\nIf you get lost in thought, simply come back to the practice, reflecting on the fact that all beings wish to be happy, and then continue your practice.&nbsp; End session Finally, let go of the phrases and rest in open awareness.\nAs you conclude this practice, reflect on the interconnectedness of all beings. Using the closing dedication or finding your own words, dedicate any positivity that might have come from this practice to the benefit of all beings Mingyur Rinpoche mentions that meditating on all beings can be challenging. In turn, he suggests expanding outward from yourself geographically to include all beings. Do you have any other strategies you use to evoke a similar experience? If so, please explain.&nbsp;If a friend were to ask what Mingyur Rinpoche means when he says \"May all beings return to their true home,\" what would you say to them?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.1.6 Love for All Beings Application\" data-href=\"2.1.6 Love for All Beings Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.6-love-for-all-beings-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.1.6 Love For All Beings, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.1.6 love for all beings, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.1.6 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Love for All Beings: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Love_for_All_Beings_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love for All Beings: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_for_All_Beings_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.6-love-for-all-beings-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.1/2.1.6-love-for-all-beings-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474496,"modifiedTime":1759272586396,"sourceSize":5928,"sourcePath":"1.

So far, we have finished four steps, and this will be the last, which we call, \"immeasurable love.\" For this step, we are going to meditate on love for all beings. Why do we call it \"immeasurable\"? Because beings are immeasurable — including not only human beings but also animals and whatever other beings there are out there. And we all share something, something we have in common, which is wanting to be happy. By now, you know that you want to be happy. Maybe you are more connected with your own feeling of wanting to be happy than before. No matter who you are, you are busy doing something, looking for something — namely happiness — though what makes you and others happy is different. Sometimes we think, \"Oh, I want to eat again and again and again...\" We have a food addiction. Sometimes we know that this is unhealthy, but at the same time, there is a feeling of craving, and we cannot stop overeating. In both cases, at a basic level, we want to be happy — the impulse, or the motivation, is that we want to be happy. But sometimes we do not know how to connect with the right causes of happiness. This is also true with smoking or drinking too much alcohol. All of these are the same thing. Eating too much ice cream is another example. Maybe we do not know the real causes of happiness, so we look for short term happiness. At the same time, we have some wisdom. \"Oh, maybe this is not good.\" But sometimes we cannot let go of this habit. Changing habits takes some time. But basically, underlying all these feelings, we are looking for happiness. Whether on the intellectual level, experiential level, or habitual level, it is the same thing. It is universal. Actually, all of us, all beings, are part of one big family. We are all like brothers and sisters. We might all look a little bit different, our languages might be different, or our skin colors might be different, but at a basic level, everybody has awareness, love, compassion, and wisdom — the same things. Now, you need to connect with love for all beings and wish, \"May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" Then your practice will become immeasurable.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nYou and your friend are at the gym. Your friend loves working out, whereas you hate it. How is it that you both are expressing the basic wish to be happy in this situation?

Congratulations on finishing this section of the course. I hope that you have found it transformative and enlivening. In this section, we focused on the aspect of our basic goodness called \"compassion.\" Mingyur Rinpoche taught us that compassion is always present — in the core of every thought, emotion, and action, the wish to avoid suffering is there. Perceiving this wish for freedom from suffering in ourselves helps us perceive it beneath the words and actions of others. As a result, our heart begins to open spontaneously. A warmth and friendliness towards others starts to emerge in more and more of our interactions. It is important to focus on the practices that come most easily to us. If self-compassion is challenging, we can begin with compassion for loved ones. If compassion for loved ones is challenging, we may want to practice with neutral people. Compassion practices are particularly good to remember in the flow of life. When difficult feelings arise, such as anger, fear, or shame, we can open our hearts to ourselves, first recognizing our suffering, then genuinely, warmly wishing for ourselves that we might be free of this. From a neuroscience point of view, doing this activates other helpful, perspective-taking regions of our brain, enabling us to shift out of the grip of these thoughts and emotions. Say we have had a tense interaction with another person — we can recognize that they believe that their actions — however unskillful — will help them to be free of suffering. In that moment, sometimes wisdom will arise, and we will relate to them in a less reactive, more skillful way. Of course, as with any practice, it is possible to get too tight with compassion practices. Sometimes we can feel that the world is so full of suffering — how can we bear it? When this happens, we can return to the practices for calming the mind or to other practices in this course for happiness, joy, or equanimity. These practices can help us relax and come back into balance. Above all, it is important to remember that compassion empowers us. For this to happen, we need to pair our compassion with wisdom. Then we can move through life truly being of the greatest help to ourselves and others. We can be our own best friend as well as the best friend of life. Conclusion by Antonia Sumbundu Read\nHello everyone. Here we are at the concluding part of this course where we have been focusing on compassion — on recognizing compassion as part of our basic goodness, as part of our inherent qualities and, then, by seeing compassion also in different ways, nourishing it so that it can really unfold and blossom. I really would like to thank you so much for the opportunity to have been the guide on this part of the journey, together with Kell, and also to let you know that the journey is not ending here. The next course will be focusing on the quality of joy. Joy is really something that I think all of us, of course, intuitively would like to have. And we will see that joy, appreciation, is actually also one of our inherent qualities, that we have this natural ability to appreciate. And again, it is something that we can look at in our own lives. We can see our own inner and outer richness and really appreciate the opportunity we have and what we have. And as we really recognize it, it is also something that will grow. It is the same with others. We can also appreciate what it is that others have, what it is that they are, and the way that they are in our lives and the world. By doing so, again, this helps to transform our experience because, rather than focusing on perhaps what we would like to change, we will really focus on what we can appreciate. And then we will experience it growing. By now, you are very familiar with the format. You are very familiar with how we are doing all of this. That is also something that is really helpful as we are moving along in this course. Again we will be working with the different categories and recognizing our basic goodness. I just really would encourage you to continue working with what you have learned so far to complete all the time with the compassion practice. Then, I would really encourage you to continue the journey and, in a very systematic and illuminating way, move on to working with joy also. Thank you so much. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3 Joy\" data-href=\"2.3 Joy\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3-joy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Go to Next Course →</a>","aliases":["2.2 Compassion, Conclusion - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2 compassion, conclusion - Tergar joy of living course","2.2 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course (12 min)","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_(12_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3-joy.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2-compassion-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475002,"modifiedTime":1759272586424,"sourceSize":5150,"sourcePath":"1.

In 2009 he met Mingyur Rinpoche and has since studied intensively with Rinpoche and the Tergar Meditation Community. During this time he has served as practice leader for the Tergar New York City Meditation Center. In addition to Kell's role with Tergar, he currently serves as head of clinical research education at a large academic community hospital in Brooklyn, where he also teaches mindfulness meditation to faculty, residents, and staff.\nWelcome from Antonia Sumbundu Antonia Sumbundu was first inspired to become a meditator after seeing a segment from The Lion's Roar, a film about the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, but it was in 1988 after attending a talk by the Dalai Lama that she began practicing formally. Antonia's first Buddhist teacher was the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche.

Try to pick one problem and see people's basic feeling, see how much they are wanting to be free from this problem, just like you. Try to intentionally see this problem and connect with the feeling that we all want to be free from that and that there is basic goodness within them.\nOf course, some of us know the causes that can free us from problems. But many of us do not know. But anyway, this basic goodness exists with all of us as compassion. Try to see that in everyday life.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTo apply this teaching in everyday life, the practice is to see how, in their essence, problems (e.g., conflict or disagreement) are expressions of the fundamental wish to be free from suffering. At the beginning of your day, cultivate the intention to use this practice with at least one problem that you encounter. When you encounter the problem, try to broaden your view and see how it is an expression of the underlying wish to be happy and free from suffering.Journal Reflection QuestionsHow does your experience change when you aspire to see problems in the world as expressions of your fundamental wish to be free from suffering? Does it become more easeful and/or less painful, or does it spark something else? Please explain.Tip\nYou do not have to get rid of anger and then develop compassion.

This is Antonia, and I really appreciate this opportunity to share a few thoughts as we are entering into this first section in the course of compassion. Here we come back to the recognition of basic goodness, which has been central to the teachings and the practices that we have been doing throughout Opening the Heart. We are coming back to the recognition of our natural goodness or our fundamental nature, what we are at the core, and what is coming to expression as love and compassion and so forth when it is not hindered or when it is not obscured. What can hinder the recognition of compassion and hinder compassion from blossoming? All our different habitual emotions and reactive patterns. Here, we will be learning to see underneath or behind all the different challenging emotional states and experiences like low self-esteem or anger and to see how these thoughts, emotions, and reactions actually are expressions of the wish to be happy. Rather than it being a matter of us not being good enough and having to improve and so forth, we start to see where they are actually coming from. We begin to soften towards ourselves and towards others at times when we need it the most. Rather than judging ourselves and others harshly, we begin to be able to respond compassionately, based on the empathetic understanding of what is happening and how it is. All of this of course is a life-long journey, and it is a journey that enriches our lives. A journey based on the recognition of awareness can bring some fresh light to our lived experience, and we can see the quality of compassion as something that is actually with us as a friend. The practices and reflections that we will be working with are really the foundation for what will be following because the recognition of compassion as an inherent quality is the main discovery. And through this recognition, then we will be exploring ways of nourishing this insight and experience so that our compassion really can blossom. It is not always easy to see compassion inside anger, low self-esteem, and so forth, or when we look back at our lives at the times when we or others were in the most pain. By doing these practices and engaging in the exploration, then what used to be hidden will gradually be uncovered. So these are really some very meaningful ways of engaging with our own experience. I really would like to take the time to wish you a good week, and I am looking forward to hearing how your practice is unfolding. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.1 Basic Goodness and Compassion View\" data-href=\"2.2.1 Basic Goodness and Compassion View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.1-basic-goodness-and-compassion-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.1 Basic Goodness And Compassion, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.1 basic goodness and compassion, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.1 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Basic Goodness and Compassion (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Basic_Goodness_and_Compassion_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.1-basic-goodness-and-compassion-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.1-basic-goodness-and-compassion-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474993,"modifiedTime":1759272586454,"sourceSize":3223,"sourcePath":"1.

But I was lazy. I liked the idea of meditation, but the practice was so difficult and hard. After practicing, I would blame myself thinking, \"Oh, I did not practice well. I am not going to achieve anything.\"\nWe all have this feeling, and this is the opposite of appreciating having basic goodness. But even though this is really painful, actually, this feeling of self-hatred comes from basic goodness and compassion. You want to be free. It is just that you care. You care about yourself. On the basic level, kindness is there. The basic feeling of just simply wanting to be free from suffering is there. But then we get caught up in the conceptual mind. We hold on to this subject, that object, this idea, that notion, and so many things, so we lose our fundamental feeling.\nNow, we are going to connect with this. Of course, normally, it is not that we can only connect with low self-esteem, but also with panic, depression, stress, phobias, worrying too much, or whatever emotion you experience. Try to connect with the suffering, this strong emotion, and, when going deeper, recognizing the feeling of just wanting to be free.\nWe are going to practice this together. First, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation]Now, you can connect — \"connect\" means to just be aware of — with the feeling of, for example, low self-esteem, the feeling of guilt, shame, or whatever you experience. Just be aware of it. Then go deeper into the root of this feeling, to the fundamental feeling, which is that you just want to be free. You can use a phrase like, \"May I be free. May I be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\"&nbsp;\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness again.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Begin by bringing awareness to your body. Notice how you feel right now. Take a few slow, deep breaths and notice how the air moves in and out of your body.\nNow, take a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. There is nothing to do. Just let go, and simply be.&nbsp; Main practice As you rest in open awareness, simply be aware of what is present in your experience. There are most likely some aspects that are uncomfortable or challenging. To begin, just notice them.\nNow, see if you can be aware of the underlying urge or wish to be free from this discomfort. It can be subtle.&nbsp;\nAs you remain aware of this urge, begin to recite this phrase in your mind: \"May I be free from suffering and its causes.\"&nbsp;\nRemember, it is completely normal to get distracted and lost in thought. If you find this is the case, gently bring your awareness back to the practice and continue reciting the phrase.&nbsp;\nDo not worry about how it feels. The point is to cultivate the intention to be aware of this fundamental wish, not to necessarily feel a certain way.&nbsp;\nNow, take a few moments to rest in open awareness. Let go of the phrases and just be.&nbsp;\nAs you rest in open awareness, simply notice what is present. Notice whether there is anything that you do not like in your experience. It could be thoughts of the past or future, sensations in your body, or something else. Whatever it is, see whether you can notice the basic urge to be free from this discomfort.&nbsp;\nAs you find helpful, use the above phrase or some other words that are more supportive for you, and recite them in your mind.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the phrases, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you bring to mind topics such as low self-esteem and shame during formal meditation, are you able to hold them in the light of basic goodness? If so, what is your experience like?Mingyur Rinpoche speaks about liking the idea of meditation, but disliking actual meditation. Can you relate to this in your own practice?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

I could never have left my room if I hadn't come to terms with my real nature, looking deep within my own mind and seeing the real power there, instead of the vulnerability I'd always thought was there.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nbasic goodness\nthe nature of suffering and ways to find relief\nthe five steps for meditating on compassion\nWatch Read\nBasic goodness, this wonderful nature, is with us all the time. It is not a separate thing, as if there is basic goodness, then love, then compassion, then awareness, then wisdom. They are all together. Just as awareness is with you 24/7, love is with you 24/7. So love and awareness are part of basic goodness. They are different qualities.&nbsp;\nAnd not only that. We have compassion. Compassion is also there with us. Sometimes we say that the difference between love and compassion is like that of two sides of a coin. Your wish to be happy is love, and your wish to be free from suffering is compassion. So they are all related, as qualities of our fundamental nature.\nSuffering is called \"dukkha\" in Sanskrit. The real meaning of dukkha is \"dissatisfaction.\" We are not satisfied. We always want more and more and, not only that, no matter how much we achieve or gain, still there is a feeling on a deeper level of being incomplete, a little bit insecure, or lonely. This is dukkha. Of course, that includes pain, discomfort, unease, panic (what I experienced), depression, stress, hatred, desire, and ignorance. All of these are what we call \"obscurations.\" What these things obscure is our basic goodness. They obscure the inner light.&nbsp;\nThe traditional example for this is a diamond. Our innate quality is like a diamond, but the diamond is covered by mud. Although the diamond is covered by mud, the diamond itself, the nature of the diamond, is always free from the mud, because the diamond is not the mud. So our innate qualities — awareness, love, compassion, and wisdom — are always pure like a diamond. They are precious, calm, profound, and peaceful.\nBut then we have these obscurations. The main thing of the obscurations begins with what we call \"ignorance.\" Ignorance means not recognizing your true or fundamental nature. That is the first thing. Because you are not connected with your fundamental nature, out of ignorance then come aversion, craving, attachment, jealousy, pride, and egoistic mind. And then come fear, a feeling of insecurity, self-hatred, and panic. It piles up, and then we follow with action, and we create problems around us with friends and family. And not only that — we create problems for the environment and destroy the environment. Then it becomes a cycle. That is dukkha. How to be free from dukkha is by connecting with our fundamental nature.\nToday, the main focus of how to recognize our fundamental nature is compassion. What is compassion? Actually, you all know that, right? The feeling of wanting to be free from dukkha. Dissatisfaction is compassion, actually, because your heart knows that you are not incomplete in the sense of the recognition level. On a deeper level, our true nature is complete, but we have the \"mud.\" We are lost in the mud. The mud is not our true nature. So, we are not happy about the mud, on the basic level. We want to get rid of that. We do not want to suffer. So basically, this is also wisdom, this is also compassion, and if you connect with that, then you connect with compassion.For this practice, you will also practice step by step.

What you feel, I feel; what I feel, you feel. There's no difference between us.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, we will discuss how to apply compassion for yourself in daily life. Try to see the feelings you have in your life while sometimes thinking: \"Oh, why did I do that? That was a mistake. That is a problem.\" Or maybe you are having a problem, right now. You might have a problem with your friends or family or a problem with a colleague at your workplace. When you feel there are all these problems, on a deeper level, you want to be free from them, right? That is compassion, so connect with that. This feeling of wanting to be free from problems is compassion. Actually, you care about yourself. It is self-compassion. At the same time, you can look at the causes of being free from suffering. Take care of yourself. Try to change your habits. Maybe you are eating too much, or maybe you have a lot of addictions. Of course, habits are not so easy to change, but they may be causes of suffering. Try to change them. And try to develop compassion through recognition of it in everyday life. You can even try to eat healthy food and try to clean and make a healthy environment around you. Build up a new habit, which is good for you in the long run. The things that are good for you, in the long run, are the causes of being free from suffering. So try these things.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesWe all make mistakes and experience pain and suffering. The practice begins by recognizing the wish to be free from suffering in these situations. This can be done in regard to past actions in which we cultivate a sense of healthy remorse. It can also be done in regard to the present moment in the form of creating new, healthier habits. For this section, choose one of your habits that might not be the healthiest. Perhaps it is overeating or indulging in surfing the Internet. Set the intention to watch what happens in your mind and body each time you engage in this activity. Most likely, there is some pain or suffering and an associated desire to change your habit. This is compassion—the wish to be free from suffering and its causes. Slowly, your awareness will allow you to start to shift this habit. Do so in a gradual manner, and be kind to yourself.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhat is it like to experience regret for past actions? Do you agree with Mingyur Rinpoche that it is an important component for cultivating compassion? If so, why? If not, why not?\nIn describing the taking practice, Mingyur Rinpoche suggests three alternatives: 1) imagining that you are inhaling dark smoke; 2) saying a phrase such as \"May I take my own past suffering\"; and 3) simply feeling that you are taking your past suffering. Do you connect more with one (or more) of these styles? If so, how do you find it more accessible?\nReflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?\nInquiry\nWhat are your unhealthy habits? Are you able to hold them with a sense of love and compassion?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.2 Compassion for Oneself Summary\" data-href=\"2.2.2 Compassion for Oneself Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.2-compassion-for-oneself-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.2 Compassion For Oneself, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.2 compassion for oneself, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.2 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for Oneself: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_Oneself_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.2-compassion-for-oneself-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.2-compassion-for-oneself-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474956,"modifiedTime":1759272586480,"sourceSize":4223,"sourcePath":"1.

But many find the thought or even the experience of self-compassion challenging.\nWe may come up with beliefs within ourselves that are common in the world: for instance, that self-compassion is a pity party or that it is self-indulgent or even selfish. \"If I am self-compassionate, maybe I will slack off. I will never achieve my goals. I will not be able to compete in the world.\" But, in fact, the opposite of each of these is true.\nEverything I am going to say around these beliefs about self-compassion is actually supported by scientific research studies. First, self-compassion is actually an antidote for self-pity. Self-pity is immobilizing, whereas self-compassion motivates us to take action. Self-compassionate people actually cope better with tough situations. They give more to others. And they are more likely to take responsibility for their actions and to apologize when they have done something wrong. Self-compassion motivates us to reach our goals because we care about ourselves. Finally, self-compassionate people are actually more resilient in facing the challenges of life.\nSeventy-nine studies of self-compassion were combined by researchers to see if the conclusions would be even stronger. The researchers concluded that self-compassion indeed can be cultivated, that by cultivating it, we improve our well-being, and that this is true for people in any location, of any age, and of any gender.\nIt is important that you find a way of practicing that is right for you. Look for what brings you a feeling of ease, warmth, friendliness for yourself and, above all, a practice that creates a sense of commitment to yourself to alleviate your suffering. That suffering can be the discomfort caused when negative emotions arise, from problems in relationships or at work, with challenges to our health.\nWhatever you choose to practice with, my wish is that it will be beneficial for you and lead you to this place of genuine warmth and caring for yourself. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.2 Compassion for Oneself View\" data-href=\"2.2.2 Compassion for Oneself View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.2-compassion-for-oneself-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.2 Compassion For Oneself, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.2 compassion for oneself, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Compassion for Oneself (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Compassion_for_Oneself_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.2-compassion-for-oneself-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.2-compassion-for-oneself-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474948,"modifiedTime":1759272586484,"sourceSize":2727,"sourcePath":"1.

We may think, \"I hate myself,\" or \"I hate him or her.\" We may see a lot of hatred, mistakes, guilt, and other problems within ourselves, others, and the world. And normally, this is a good thing. In Joy of Living level 1, we talk about the \"waterfall experience.\" It is the same thing here. With the practice of love and compassion, in the beginning, when you receive this teaching, you think, \"Wow! How wonderful! Even hatred is love.\" But when you practice, you think, \"Where is it? I cannot feel any love!\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] There is a lot of \"blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.\" All this junk comes. But this is a good sign, a sign of progress. Remember that, when you see this junk, you do not like it. That is compassion. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Why do you think, \"I am getting worse\"? You would like to be nice and do better, but you feel like you are not improving and have become worse, and you do not like that. That is love and compassion, right there. For the first step of the practice of compassion, begin with yourself. Here, you are going to begin with either the past or future. Maybe you feel, \"I made this mistake in the past,\" or \"I had this problem in the past.\" Everybody makes mistakes, right? The important thing is to forgive, continue to grow, and learn from that. This practice is to connect with that deeper level of whatever past mistakes, problems, obstacles, suffering, or pain you have had. On a deeper level, you want to be free from that. Connect with that, and bring whatever past suffering and the causes of suffering you have had to the present. We did what we call \"taking and sending practice\" in the love practice by sending love. Here, with the practice of compassion, we practice this by taking. So you can take your past suffering and the causes of suffering. Let's practice together. Please keep your meditation posture. [Silent meditation] Rest your mind in open awareness. Now, think about your past — the suffering and the causes of suffering, your failures, mistakes, or problems of the past. Now, breathe in. Take all these problems into yourself now. Breathe out. Now, breathe in a little bit deeper. You can imagine taking all this past suffering as a dark color or just use the phrase \"May I take my own past suffering\" or feel that you are taking your past suffering. [Silent meditation] You can wish, \"May I be free from my past suffering and the causes of suffering.\"[Silent meditation] Now, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay. How was it? Are you feeling comfortable or do you feel like, \"Why should I take this problem into myself? This is not my business. Whatever has passed is past.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] This is normal. Actually, your wanting to take the problem is precious. This is really compassionate. In order to train in this compassion, to expand it to others, we do the first step with ourselves. If you did it with your past, you can do it with your future, right? So then, slowly, you can do it with others. We will practice with others in the next section. Thank you! 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session As you begin, find a comfortable posture. The spine is upright and the muscles are relaxed and at ease.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.\nNext, rest the mind in open awareness, letting everything be just as it is. There is no need to do anything or fabricate any state. Just rest. Main practice Now, bring to mind an instance of suffering from your past. Reflect on the discomfort that you felt during this time.\nAs you reflect on this experience, you can imagine that the suffering you felt is represented by black smoke. Then, imagine that as you breathe in, this discomfort is alleviated.\nThere is no need to alter your breath. Instead, just match the imagination to the breath as you breathe naturally.\nAs much as is helpful, you can also incorporate the phrase: May I be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\nRemember, it is completely normal to get lost in thought. If you get distracted, gently return to the practice and continue, either with the phrase or the imagination practice described above.\nNow, take a break from the practice and let go of the phrases and images. Simply rest in open awareness.\nWhenever it feels appropriate, once again bring to mind a past experience in which you experienced suffering. Use either the phrase or images as described above and continue your practice. End session Now, let go of the phrase and images, and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing and just be.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. These practices include a range of analytical and imaginative techniques, such as imagining your past self, thinking about the basic wish to be free from suffering, and so on. How is your experience of these more complex practices different from your experience of those found in Joy of Living Level 1: Calming the Mind?In describing the&nbsp;taking practice, Mingyur Rinpoche suggests three alternatives: 1) imagining that you are inhaling dark smoke; 2) saying a phrase such as \"May I take my own past suffering\"; and 3) simply feeling that you are taking your past suffering. Do you connect more with one (or more) of these styles? If so, how do you find it more accessible?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

Such surprises—along with subtler, less noticeable experiences like the aches and pains that come with age, the frustration of waiting in line at the grocery store, or simply running late for an appointment—can all be understood as manifestations of suffering.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe first of five steps for the practice of compassion\nan example from his own life about how he dealt with difficult emotions\nthe role of seeing the deeper level of emotions on the path\nhow obstacles can become opportunities\nWatch Read\nThe first step of practicing compassion is to practice it for yourself.\nWhen I was young, I had these panic attacks, and I looked for a solution. Then I received meditation teachings from my father, and I began to meditate.\nFor me, the main problem was the panic of panic, fear of panic, or aversion of panic. I really did not like my panic. When I meditated, it really helped. But the panic of panic was so strong that it sometimes overwhelmed me, and I could not practice. I shared this with my father, and he said, \"Do not fight the panic. Welcome it. The panic is your friend. You can use the panic as support for your meditation.\" This is because, actually, everything we experience is a manifestation of our pure inner nature, our basic or original nature. For example, the ocean is water, so no matter how many waves there are, how they form, or what shapes or colors they have, they are still water.\nI heard this, and it really helped me, but I still felt resistance. In the end, I went to a three-year retreat. I thought it would be really good for my panic, but it was only beneficial at the beginning — for one month only. Then I became lazy, and the panic became stronger than before. In the end, I decided, \"Okay. Now I really want to make friends with my panic. I am not going to fight my panic anymore. I will use it as a support for my meditation.\"\nThe moment I really decided to make panic my friend, I began to change my reaction to it. I began to like my panic when the symptoms came. My heartbeat was very fast, I felt a tightness around my neck, I got headaches — all these symptoms came — but on a deeper level, I was quite excited. I thought, \"Now, I am going to use my panic as support for awareness, love, and compassion.\" I tried this transformation practice, which I will teach you later. It is really important. In the end, my panic and I became very good friends. Normally, I say that panic was my teacher and my friend. It is true.\nThis is not only true for panic. We all have something we do not like. We do not want to suffer. We do not like problems. We do not like negative emotions. We do not want to be stressed. We do not want to be depressed. But on a deeper level, all of these are manifestations of love, compassion, awareness, and wisdom. So, actually, they all can be transformed. When you connect with the deeper level of their true nature, they automatically transform. You may see the waves as \"monsters\" chasing after you, but once you recognize that they are just waves, water, then the concept of \"monster\" is gone. You can swim.\nMy father and other teachers told me, \"Obstacles become opportunities. Failure is the mother of success.\" Therefore, if we really use our basic goodness, our own wisdom, we can transform everything. We can learn from all problems, obstacles, and mistakes. We can grow from them. This is why these obstacles become opportunities. On a deeper level, we are fantastic. There are no mistakes. Everything is perfect. This is really important to understand about yourself.\nI know that we all have problems, and we all make mistakes. That is normal. Do not give up. Connect with your inner fundamental qualities, and go forward. Letting go is not giving up. Of course, let go of holding onto problems. Do not get attached to them.

You just recognize this motivation or feeling in yourself.\nIn everyday life, when you are meeting your friend, a good or best friend, family members, pets, or a colleague at your workplace whom you normally like, there is a wanting to help, a wanting to share, and a wanting to support them. The feeling, the motivation, is always there. Recognize that. Just try to connect with that.\nThat is all. It is very simple.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAs mentioned before, we all share the fundamental wish to be free from suffering. Many times this gets obscured due to the surface-level emotions we experience. At the start of each day, choose a loved one to work with in this practice. It could be a family member, co-worker, friend, or even a pet. First, set the intention to recognize their basic nature and wish to be free from suffering. Next, set the intention to be aware of the subtle ways in which you wish to be of benefit to them. And, finally, whenever possible, act on this intention and support them in whatever way(s) you feel comfortable.Journal Reflection Questions\nDo you find it possible to remain aware of your and/or others' fundamental wish to be free from suffering? Are there particular strategies and/or circumstances that help support you in this?\nHow does practicing with compassion for another differ from practicing with yourself?

This week we will be continuing the exploration of compassion, the recognition of our inherent compassion. Compassion is something that is with us unconditionally, yet we may not fully see it or experience it. Last week we worked with compassion for ourselves, and this week we will be working with compassion for someone who is dear to us — a loved one. The intention is to begin somewhere where it is relatively easy for us. We recognize our own basic goodness, and we recognize our loved one's basic goodness, seeing that they, just like us, wish to be happy and that they, just like us, have compassion. And we recognize that compassion is what motivates or drives many of their actions and reactions. This piece of the practice in itself widens our perspective and understanding of the people who are dear to us or who are loved ones. I have found it a really heartwarming practice, because, of course, we feel that we know our loved ones — that is why we put them in that category — but through this practice, we do not just get to know ourselves better, we also get to know them better, at a deeper level. The meditation practice that we will be introduced to this week is very rich. And there are different options or elements in the practice that we can explore. We can explore simply being with the feeling or the motivation of compassion towards a loved one. We can work with phrases that express compassion, or we can imagine that we are taking in their pain or suffering and sending them love. So this is very rich material. These instructions are something, as we work them, that can keep unfolding. It is also something that we can come back to again and again. I encourage you to see what inspires you and helps your practice to feel alive and nourishing. I also encourage you to explore what treasures may be revealed by some of the elements that you do not immediately feel so connected to. It may be that it just takes more time for it to unfold, and often this is where we also learn a lot. I wish you a good time with the practice and look forward to hearing how everything unfolds. <a data-href=\"2.2.3 Compassion for a Loved One View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2.2.3 Compassion for a Loved One View</a>","aliases":["2.2.3 Compassion For A Loved One, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.3 compassion for a loved one, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Compassion for a Loved One (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Compassion_for_a_Loved_One_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474902,"modifiedTime":1759272586523,"sourceSize":2840,"sourcePath":"1.

It's always with us. It always has been, and always will be. When it arises in us, we've simply learned to see how strong and safe we already are.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nFor the practice of compassion for a loved one, you are going to practice recognizing that your loved one is the same as you — they want to be free from suffering, 24/7. You try to connect with that, to see this basic innate goodness in your loved one, which is compassion. You feel the genuine compassion that is there with your loved one always. At the same time, you wish that your loved one be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. We always emphasize the causes of suffering — to be free from the causes of suffering, we connect with compassion, wisdom, and awareness. Also, you wish that they be free from suffering, affliction, and ignorance. You wish that, and at the same time, if you like, you can do the taking and sending practice. Here, we are going to add the taking. In the practice of love, we practiced sending love and happiness to others as a bright light — or anything can be used. Now, you take the suffering, kleshas, and afflictions, or negative emotions, of your loved ones into yourself. You can imagine it, if you like, as a dark light, or you can feel it or use a phrase. It depends on you. Now we are going to practice this together. Please keep your meditation posture and just rest in awareness. Rest the mind as it is. [Silent meditation] Now, think of someone you like and connect with the original nature, the feeling of compassion, within that being. That being is wanting to be free from suffering all the time. [Silent meditation] Now wish, \"May you be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" [Silent meditation] Now we are going to do the taking and sending practice. Breathe in a little bit deeply and take others' suffering into your suffering.&nbsp;Breathe out and send your happiness, your virtue, to others, to your loved ones. You can breathe slowly. Take a deep breath in and gently send it out. Wish that your loved one be free from suffering. [Silent meditation] When you try to practice this, from time to time, your mind might seem to become blank. \"I am going to take...\" It is okay — that is open awareness. Be with that. And again, feel the compassion. Now rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay, how was it? Does it feel easy, or does it feel like, \"If I take others' suffering, am I going to suffer more and more?\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] \"I am not ready yet. I have enough problems, suffering, and panic. Why would I want to take others' panic?\" That is normal. Actually, that is a good sign because we have this unhealthy sense of self, which is really narrow and too selfish. When we take others' suffering into ourselves, that unhealthy sense of self becomes nervous. So it is a good sign. Actually, our real self is the healthy sense of self — the self with compassion, love, awareness, and wisdom. This self is very vast, open, grounded, peaceful, and strong also — soft, but strong. That is the healthy sense of self. So, in the beginning, you might feel like that, but, actually, when you think that you are taking others' suffering into yourself, it is virtue. It is wisdom, also. It is compassion. This is what I sometimes call \"inner recycling\": when you take others' suffering into yourself, then what happens is that it transforms into virtue, into compassion. Then it becomes light. You are taking darkness, but once you receive it, it becomes light. And you can send that light to others, also. It becomes a circle of goodness. So do not worry about having more suffering or panic. Actually, you will purify your panic and suffering. You will free yourself from panic and suffering. One of the causes of suffering is this unhealthy sense of self — once you are free from that, you will really become happy. Genuine happiness comes from that. 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Take a moment to check in with your posture. Notice that even in this simple act of settling into a comfortable posture, the wish to be at ease and free from suffering is present.&nbsp;\nBring awareness to what is happening in your body. What do you feel? See whether you can let go of the \"doing\" energy that can build up in your body. Just be and rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Now, bring to mind someone with whom you feel a connection. This could be a family member, a friend, or even a pet. The important part is that they naturally cause you to feel affection towards them. Imagine that they are actually here with you.&nbsp;\nRecognize that, just like you, they face challenges and difficulties in their life. And, just like you, they do not want to suffer.&nbsp;\nNext, to remain connected to this recognition, you can recite the phrase in your mind: \"May you be free from suffering and its causes.\" If these words do not resonate with you, feel free to choose others that do.&nbsp;\nAlternatively, you can use your breath and imagination. As you breathe out, you can imagine that you offer them your well-being and happiness. And, as you breathe in, you can imagine that you relieve them from their hardships and suffering.&nbsp;\nRemember, it is completely normal to get lost in thought. If you get distracted, gently return to the practice and continue either with the phrases or the imagination practice described above.&nbsp;\nNow, take a break from the practice and let go of the phrases and images. Simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nWhenever it feels appropriate, once again bring to mind someone you love. Reflect on how, just like you, they wish to be free from suffering. Use either the phrase or images described above and continue your practice.&nbsp; End session Let go of the phrase and images and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing and just be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche mentions that there can be adverse reactions when one begins to practice sending and taking, such as having fear around taking in others' suffering. How do you practice with responses like these? Do you have specific strategies that you incorporate?Mingyur Rinpoche proposes three styles to use in the taking and sending practice: 1) imagining light (exhale) and darkness (inhale) while breathing; 2) using phrases to wish others to be free from suffering; 3) and simply feeling the wish in your felt-sense experience. Do you connect with one or another more strongly? If so, which one? Please explain what your experience is like.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.3 Compassion for a Loved One Application\" data-href=\"2.2.3 Compassion for a Loved One Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.3 Compassion For A Loved One, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.3 compassion for a loved one, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.3 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Compassion for a Loved One: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Compassion_for_a_Loved_One_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for a Loved One: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_a_Loved_One_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474898,"modifiedTime":1759272586528,"sourceSize":8240,"sourcePath":"1.

We began with ourselves to understand that compassion is innate and that it is always there within us. Now we need to expand this to others. There are two things here. The first is that we are expanding our own compassion to others, and the second is that, at the same time, we are recognizing that this compassion is there with others. Normally, with any practice, we have to begin with an easy step, so now you will choose someone that is easy for you to develop compassion with — someone you like. You can choose your grandma or anybody in your life, but do not choose someone you love the most and hate the most. Sometimes that produces a lot of emotions, and in the end you cannot practice. Other than that, it does not matter — it can even be an animal. Normally it is easy to feel this compassion. You should develop compassion but, at the same time, let go of compassion. Sometimes our minds are too tight about compassion. The main important point is that we are now trying to connect with our innate compassion, compassion that is with you all the time — unconditional compassion. The problem is that while there is compassion deep down within us, at the surface level there is the conceptual mind, the thinking mind. So normally our compassion is filtered by the thinking mind, the conceptual mind. So let's say there is a bright light here [Mingyur Rinpoche holds up his hand to represent the light], and this light is maybe covered by a glass that has a lot of different colors. If you cover the light like this, then what you see is that the room is full of different colors. Then you can layer it with another glass full of scary images. If you cover the light like this, then you will see that your room is full of scary images. But all of these are coming from the light. Without light, you do not see these scary images. But normally what happens is that we are grasping and lost with the scary images. So what we see is that the room is full of scary images, but we do not see that these are coming from the light. What we see is that these are real crocodiles, leopards, spiders, or bears. But these are just images from the light. Therefore, the important thing here is that we just connect with unconditional compassion, and in order to do that, of course, we have to use the conceptual mind. Not all concepts are bad. There are good concepts. Egoistic concepts like \"I have to always win, and the others have to lose\" — that kind of concept is a negative concept. But if you want to help your loved ones and slowly expand that to others, it is still a concept, but a good concept.&nbsp;Also, the important thing is to not get attached to this concept. Sometimes we are too caught up in that, and we feel bad. When I was young, there was a cow, almost like a wild cow. It had no owner, and it was just wandering in the mountains. I liked this cow, and we became friends. One day this cow broke her leg, so she could not move around or drink water. I was very young, maybe around seven or eight, and I tried to help the cow. I brought water in a jug and gave it to her. She drank it, and, right away, the jug became empty again. Then, again, I brought another jug, and I tried my best. But I could not feed the cow all the time, and, eventually, the cow died. I was not happy for a long time. I felt really bad.Later, what I found was that I cannot help everybody. The important thing is to try our best and use our skills, knowledge, capacity, or whatever we have. At the same time, our minds can be too tight about the result, so finding a balance is really important. Many people, when they practice compassion, think, \"Oh, I am a compassion meditator, but I cannot help my friend. I cannot help that person.\" Sometimes they feel too tight about that. So try your best, but of course life is changing like the waves of the ocean, and you cannot help everybody. Your life and other lives are like that. The important thing here is to connect with this feeling and motivation, that wanting to be free from suffering. This feeling is almost nonconceptual, unconditional. It is just there, and you connect with that. Once this feeling becomes stronger and stronger, you automatically have the capacity to help others. The power of your mind, the strength of compassion, and the confidence of that becomes stronger. Then, according to your capacity and ability, you can help others. This is why it is really important to find balance and to just connect with the deeper level of this feeling. Sometimes we call it a \"feeling,\" but remember that \"feeling\" does not mean, \"Aaah, compassion, ooh!\" It is not that kind of feeling. It is more like motivation. It is always there with you. We are looking for a special feeling, but actually we are in that compassion feeling or motivation. Sometimes you do not feel it — what we normally call a \"feeling\" may not be there because it is always there with you, and you do not feel it is special. So maybe you can understand it as \"motivation.\" Just connect with\nthat. The object is the same as with love. When you practice love, you choose someone you like. It is the same thing here. We are going to practice this together in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche&nbsp;explains how we often focus on the actions of other people and miss the fact that, at their core, others share the wish to be free from suffering and its causes, just like us. Can you think of examples in which this is the case in your life? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that we need to use the conceptual mind in order to train in cultivating compassion. How might you explain this to a friend? Points to remember:\nYou practice expanding compassion for others by starting with someone you feel love towards.\nNon-conceptual compassion is with you all the time.\nYou must find balance between cultivating compassion and letting go of the results.\nBelow the surface-level experiences of difficult emotions is the wish to be free from suffering and its causes.\nTip\nSimply cultivate the intention to be compassionate, and let go of the results.\nInquiry\nWho needs your compassion right now?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nhow Buddhists define compassion and how this differs from colloquial usage\nthe biological origins of compassion\nthe interconnection between compassion and wisdom The Joy of Living, pp. 105-107 (Ch. 7: \"The Biology of Compassion\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.3 Compassion for a Loved One Meditation\" data-href=\"2.2.3 Compassion for a Loved One Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.3 Compassion For A Loved One, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.3 compassion for a loved one, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Compassion for a Loved One: View (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Compassion_for_a_Loved_One_View_(8_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for a Loved One: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_a_Loved_One_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.3-compassion-for-a-loved-one-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474884,"modifiedTime":1759272586544,"sourceSize":7955,"sourcePath":"1.

Here, the object is a neutral person. That means, when you go into your daily life, you can do whatever is possible according to your ability and capacity. Try to help others, even strangers, if they need help. Of course, you need balance. Do not always ask, \"Do you need help? Do you need help?\" It is not like that. But if you can really help and have the time and capacity, and you are not helping — it is not like that. Try your best to balance. When you go out and see garbage, maybe you can take it and put it in a garbage bag — just little things like that. It can help the environment, and it might help many other people, including people you do not know. And suffering is universal. So it does not matter if they are poor or rich, if they have power or not, or if they have money or not — it does not matter. Everybody has suffering. Even the richest people in the world have suffering. Or if they are poor, poor people in the world also have their own suffering. Or if they are in the middle class, they have their own suffering. It is not like we always practice this with someone who looks like they are lacking material-wise, but rather with everybody — whoever you see. Apply this in your daily life and do something — some small actions.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nAs you go about your daily activities, try to help others according to your circumstances and capacity. This could include small acts like holding the door open or picking up pieces of garbage on the ground. Everything counts. As you do this, remember that suffering does not discriminate based on geography, finances, or anything else. We all experience suffering.\nIn addition to the practice above, you can engage in the following: We often tend to focus on the obvious suffering we can see and hear, especially regarding people who are less fortunate and privileged in society. However, we often fail to recognize that people we normally view as successful, happy, well cared for, etc., also experience suffering. This can be seen, for example, in the drug abuse and even suicides among celebrities whom we often think of as people who have \"made it.\" When you come across people in these situations—perhaps in a magazine or on television—try practicing compassion with them as well.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nWhen you cultivate the intention to be aware of others' innate wish to be free from suffering, how does this change your experience?&nbsp;\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that suffering does not discriminate, and that it is universal. What strategies do you implement to help you remember this truth? Does this truth affect how you view people you would otherwise think of as happy due to their success? If so, explain how.&nbsp;\nWhy does Mingyur Rinpoche say it is important to find balance? What does balance look like when you take an approach of compassion-in-action?\nTip\nFind your own balance between helping and recharging your own energy. This is key to maintaining a compassionate outlook.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.4 Compassion for a Neutral Person Summary\" data-href=\"2.2.4 Compassion for a Neutral Person Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.4 Compassion For A Neutral Person, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.4 compassion for a neutral person, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.4 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for a Neutral Person: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_a_Neutral_Person_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474868,"modifiedTime":1759272586559,"sourceSize":4144,"sourcePath":"1.

But we recognize that these judgments are assumptions. They are not based on actual experience. So these are the neutral people in our world. Of course, because we do not know much about them, we also do not know the specific details of the suffering that they undergo. This can be a stumbling block to meditating on compassion for neutral people, so perhaps the following will help: When you consider your own life, are your relationships with all of your family members completely free from discomfort? Are you totally happy with yourself? Or is there some discomfort there, too? Is your physical health perfect, or do you have some health challenges, small or large? How about your job and the activities you do in the world — are they free from discomfort? Do you have enough money so that you do not need to worry or budget or make sacrifices, either now or for the future? Do you get along perfectly with your neighbors and your community members? When I ask these questions, almost everyone identifies areas of suffering or discomfort in every one of these areas. So, when you practice compassion for a neutral person, whether you are doing this in your formal practice, while walking down the street, or during any activity of life, you might bring these areas to mind and reflect on the suffering or discomfort that the people that you encounter experience in those areas of life. Realize that even though you do not know the details, this person's life is full of discomfort and uncertainty, just like yours. This may help you to bring that feeling of warmth to them and to actively wish for them that their suffering be relieved and that they find the wisdom to become truly free from suffering. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.4 Compassion for a Neutral Person View\" data-href=\"2.2.4 Compassion for a Neutral Person View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.4 Compassion For A Neutral Person, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.4 compassion for a neutral person, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Compassion for a Neutral Person (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Compassion_for_a_Neutral_Person_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474859,"modifiedTime":1759272586564,"sourceSize":2658,"sourcePath":"1.

Its basic meaning is \"feeling with,\" a recognition that what you feel, I feel. Anything that hurts you hurts me. Anything that helps you helps me.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nIn the practice of compassion for a neutral person, the idea is the same as in the practice of love. You choose a person that you do not particularly like or hate — maybe just a random person. That person is the same as you, wishing to be free from suffering 24/7, all the time, with every movement and every breath, and every time he or she walks. Each step is looking for happiness, actually. Each movement is looking for happiness. So we understand that and wish that that person be free from suffering. We are going to practice this together. First, keep your meditation posture and rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, think of a neutral person in your mind. It could be a person or animal — it does not matter. That person is the same as you. He or she wishes to be happy and free from suffering, especially, all the time and does not want to have any problems or obstacles. You can wish, \"May you be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" You can use a phrase. You can use the taking and sending practice with the breath. Or you can feel them being free from suffering. [Silent meditation] Now, rest your mind in open awareness. Sometimes, we may feel, \"Oh, I am not doing this practice well.\" Or we may think that when we feel compassion, we might have pain. Sometimes, we have this feeling of compassion with ourselves. Whatever you feel or whatever sensation you have in the body, just be with it. Whether you are doing it right or wrong does not matter. Whether you feel it or not does not matter. Just be with whatever feeling there is 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your meditation posture. Just allow yourself to be present in your body.&nbsp;\nRest the mind in open awareness and simply be.&nbsp;\nNow, take a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Now, as you move into compassion practice, reflect on the fact that in your own experience, you feel a wish to be free from pain and suffering.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind a neutral person—someone whom you do not have strong feelings of like or dislike for. Reflect on the fact that, just like you, they too have experiences of pain and hardship. And, just like you, they share in the wish to be free from their suffering.&nbsp;\nAs you hold an image of this person in your mind or feel their presence, silently recite the phrase: \"May you be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\"\nRemember, it is completely normal to get lost in thought. If you get distracted, gently return to the practice. Bring to mind the image of the neutral person or a felt sense of them, and continue the phrase as described above.&nbsp;\nAt times, take a break from the practice and let go of the phrase and images. Just rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nWhenever it feels appropriate, once again bring to mind this neutral person and reflect on how, just like you, they too wish to be free from suffering. Use the phrase as described above.&nbsp; End session Let go of the images and phrases and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing and just be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Do you notice any shift in your experience while meditating on compassion for a neutral person, as compared to your loved one? If so, please explain. If not, please explain what is similar.How does your formal meditation on compassion for neutral beings help solidify the understanding that all beings wish to be free from suffering?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

Until now, you practiced compassion for yourself and your loved ones. Between these two, the choice of which you begin with is flexible. You need to begin with an easy step. Now we need to expand more, so the third step is for a neutral person. There are a lot of neutral people in our lives. We try to see that everybody has compassion and wish that they be free from suffering. They want to be free from suffering — that is compassion on a basic level. And you also wish them to be free from suffering. In this way, you are expanding your compassion more, and at the same time you are recognizing innate compassion within them. Of course, when we think, \"If I recognize this feeling within others and wish them to be free from this suffering\" — sometimes we feel like pain will come from this — \"when I feel their pain, I will have pain, and I will be more unhappy.\" Sometimes we feel like that, but that is normal. That is okay. Actually, when we focus too much on our own suffering, our unhealthy sense of self has too much grasping and tightness with that, from a selfish base, and our minds become more sensitive and narrow. But if we understand others' suffering, then actually our minds become more open. There is a traditional story about when Buddha was in India and a woman came who had a baby who had died. She brought the baby's dead body and said to Buddha, \"Please help me so my baby will come back to life.\" She was asking Buddha for a miracle or something like that. Buddha said, \"Okay, but before I bless your baby, I want you to do something.\" So Buddha gave her homework, which was to go to different houses in the town and get a few grains from the family in which no one had died before. She had to take some grains from them. And she was very happy. She went to the entire town looking for these grains, and she could not find them. In the end, she came back to Buddha and said, \"I searched the entire town, and I cannot find these grains. In everybody's family, someone has died. What should I do?\" And Buddha said, \"Yes, that is life. Not only your baby has died — everybody has this situation.\" So then she thought, \"Why, yes,\" and she felt more relieved. She no longer felt bad that her child had died. Her mind became more open once she accepted that others also suffer and that she was not alone. Another story is that of a friend who was not happy. He always thought, \"Oh, I am not happy. I suffer a lot. I have some problems.\" He felt like he was the only one who had this problem. He felt tightness and pain in his stomach, and he was always unhappy. He was young, and he thought, \"Oh, I am with my family. If I move out, I will be free and independent.\" So when he turned eighteen years old, he was so happy, and then he thought, \"Now, finally, I will be happy.\" He had a big birthday celebration, and he was quite happy for a few days. Then, after he finished, he went back home and felt tight, lonely, and unhappy again. He thought, \"Oh, I do not have a job. If I get a job, I will be happy.\" And he looked for and got a good job. He was happy for a few days, and again he became unhappy. He thought, \"I need to get a promotion.\" Then he got a promotion and became the CEO of a big company. In the end, he became the boss of a big company on Wall Street in New York. But he still was not happy, and he thought, \"Why?\" One day he was at his own office looking at the garden of Central Park from the window, smoking, and there was a knock at the door. He opened it, and there was the board of directors. They said, \"You served the company very well your entire life, and we really appreciate it. Now it is time for you to retire.\" He thought, \"Oh! I still have not found real happiness.\" But he accepted and retired. Then, he thought, \"Okay, now I have to look for something new — a new way to look for happiness.\" And one day he went to the bookstore and picked up a book and opened it to the first page, which said, \"Life is suffering.\" And he was so happy. \"Wow! This is such a relief — I am not the only one who suffers. No wonder.\" From that day on, he felt like his mind began to be a little more open, and it helped him a lot. This is why when we really understand others' suffering, it actually really helps us to be happier and more open. At the same time, we feel more compassion for others, so we are also able to help others. It becomes a circle of goodness. When we realize that we are not alone, we are not suffering alone, that is the beginning of accepting the suffering. Once we accept the suffering, then that is the beginning of being free from suffering. So this is a really important practice.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche tells the story of his friend who searched his entire life for happiness and freedom from suffering. This man experienced great personal and professional success, yet throughout it all, he was still not happy. The story ends with him opening a book in which the first line reads: \"Life is suffering.\" This caused him immense relief and happiness. If you were telling this story to a friend, how would you explain why the man found such relief in reading this sentence?\nPoints to remember:\nThe next step in expanding the practice of meditating on compassion is to include neutral people.\nThe first step in relieving yourself of suffering is accepting it.\nEveryone possesses innate compassion, i.e., the wish to be free from suffering.\nSuffering is universal, not personal.\nInquiry\nAre you able to see that we all possess innate compassion?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nthe unique qualities of love and compassion from a Buddhist perspective\nthe power of moving beyond an intellectual understanding of compassion\nhow recognizing the universality of compassion in all beings brings you closer to your true nature\nhow we are all profoundly interconnected The Joy of Living, pp. 173–175 (Ch. 13: \"The Meaning of Loving-Kindness and Compassion\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.4 Compassion for a Neutral Person Meditation\" data-href=\"2.2.4 Compassion for a Neutral Person Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.4 Compassion For A Neutral Person, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.4 compassion for a neutral person, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Compassion for a Neutral Person: View (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Compassion_for_a_Neutral_Person_View_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for a Neutral Person: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_a_Neutral_Person_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.4-compassion-for-a-neutral-person-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474849,"modifiedTime":1759272586585,"sourceSize":7311,"sourcePath":"1.

This is very simple. The next time you are facing this difficult person, or in general in your life — not while you are on the cushion meditating, but while you are contemplating, when you have time — write something. You need to write down five qualities. Write down five good qualities about that difficult person. Of course, we all have love and compassion and all those things. Plus, if you see any other good qualities within that person, just write them down. If you cannot find five, you can begin with three.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesBring to mind a difficult person in your life. This could be someone who has harmed you or generally rubs you the wrong way. As you reflect on this person, identify five good qualities this person possesses. Perhaps this person is a good employee, or perhaps they are a loved father or mother. If this seems too difficult, start with three qualities. Also, recognize that this person's actions are driven by his or her negative emotions. This practice will help to break down the resistance you have toward the person and open your heart.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhat happens in your heart as you bring to mind a difficult person?&nbsp;\nAs you reflect on their good qualities, as Mingyur Rinpoche instructs you to, what changes in your experience?

This week we will be working with compassion for someone who is challenging for us, who we call a \"difficult person.\"\nInterestingly enough, as you probably already have noticed, these categories are not fixed or permanent. They are usually temporary by nature. Sometimes we can actually place ourselves in this category, and, certainly, we may find that someone who was previously a neutral person to us or maybe even a loved one for us is now in this category. It can be really helpful to keep this perspective of how relative it is as we are entering into these practices, because now, for whatever reason, we are experiencing a specific person as difficult. We may feel hurt, we may feel scared, we may feel disappointed, or we may feel something else. This is the starting point: acknowledging our own situation and experience and seeing the compassion underneath this feeling or view. The feeling of hurt and so forth is coming from compassion. We have investigated this very carefully for weeks with ourselves, loved ones, and neutral persons. And we can ask ourselves if we have ever found one person who did not have the wish to be free of suffering, if we have found one person so far that did not have compassion. These are the findings that we will enter into this week's exploration with. Could it be that this difficult person is just like me and all the others that I have investigated — that this person also wants to be free of suffering? It is often challenging to work with a difficult person. It is helpful to remember that it is not expected that we will have a particular emotion, and that compassion really is the response to empathy. And there are different thought experiments that help us explore the other person's situation and motivations and that can help us soften our thinking, making our minds more flexible and opening our hearts more. So this holds a lot of potential for learning and insights. Thank you for listening to these comments. I hope you will enjoy the teachings and practice instructions. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.5 Compassion for a Difficult Person View\" data-href=\"2.2.5 Compassion for a Difficult Person View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.5-compassion-for-a-difficult-person-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.5 Compassion For A Difficult Person, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.5 compassion for a difficult person, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.5 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Compassion for a Difficult Person (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Compassion_for_a_Difficult_Person_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.5-compassion-for-a-difficult-person-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.5-compassion-for-a-difficult-person-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474831,"modifiedTime":1759272586609,"sourceSize":2802,"sourcePath":"1.

First, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, think of that difficult being in your mind. That being is the same as you and just wants to be free from suffering and problems but maybe does not know what the real causes of being free from suffering are. Maybe he or she is controlled by kleshas. Now wish, \"May he or she be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" You can use phrases or imagine or feel it. It is up to you. And if you want, you can do a breathing exercise. Take that being's suffering into yourself and send your compassion to them. [Silent meditation] Whatever works for you, you can do. [Silent meditation] Or there is another way to do this analytical meditation: Think of that difficult person as the object of somebody's love and compassion. Maybe the best friend of that difficult person loves him or her a lot. For you, that person is difficult, but maybe for his or her friends, family, or colleagues, that person is the nicest person in the world. Look from that perspective — the perspective of the difficult person's family or friends. [Silent meditation] \"May you be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" [Silent meditation] Okay, now rest your mind in open awareness. Whatever sensations or feelings you have — just let them come and let them go. Whether you feel compassion or not, whether you did it well or not, does not matter. It is all in awareness. And it is all in basic compassion, also. Be with the \"right\" or \"wrong,\" \"doing it well\" or \"badly,\" and the feeling of understanding the practice well or not. Be with everything in the union of awareness and compassion. 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session Start by finding a comfortable and balanced posture.\nNotice how you feel right now, in this moment. If you find it helpful, you can take a few deep breaths, allowing your body to relax with each exhalation.&nbsp;\nNext, relax in open awareness. Drop all the doing and simply be.&nbsp;\nNow, take a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind someone who is difficult for you. Remember, you do not want to start with the most challenging person. Instead, select someone who just rubs you the wrong way. It could be a co-worker or family member.&nbsp;\nIt is completely natural to become aware of this person's shortcomings. In this practice, however, the emphasis is on recognizing the common ground you share with him or her. This commonality is the wish to be free from suffering.&nbsp;\nWith this person in mind, reflect on the fact that, just like you, they do not want to suffer. As is useful, find a compassionate phrase that feels natural to you and recite it while holding this difficult person in your mind.&nbsp;\nIt is completely normal to feel resistance to this process. Simply try to recognize this person's wish to be free from suffering.&nbsp;\nAt times, drop the practice and let go of the phrases. Just simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nWhenever it feels appropriate, once again bring to mind this difficult person, reflecting on how, just like you, they too wish to be free from suffering. With this fact in mind, imagine that as you breathe out, you send them well-being and ease. And as you breathe in, imagine that you relieve their suffering.&nbsp; End session Let go of the images and phrases and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing, and just be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone.

Now we are going to expand your compassion more, just like with love. Difficult people are people you do not like. Here, it is the same as with love — they could be people at your workplace, family members, or members of your society, country, or whatever. These people are actually just the same as you. On a fundamental level, they have this genuine compassion. They just want to be free from problems, suffering, uneasiness, and obstacles, just like you. So you need to connect with that in them and know that you and this difficult person are the same. Maybe the problem is that they do not know what the real causes to be free from suffering are. What we wish is to be free from suffering, but sometimes what we do is create the causes of suffering. We follow the hatred, selfishness, harmful mind, and jealousy. We follow strong concepts, grasping, and craving. In the end, the real enemy is your own affliction. That really harms you. Those who seem to really harm others also want to be free, but they do not know what the causes of freedom are. They want to be free from suffering, but they also harm themselves. There are people who are suffering now as a result of their own actions, and there are people who are making the causes of suffering now. I think people who are making the causes of suffering are the ones we need to practice compassion with more because they are not just unhappy now — they are making the causes of suffering, and they will have more suffering and problems in the future. As we talked about for the practice of love, the people who follow hatred, the harmful mind, all of this, cannot control the emotion when it comes, just like you. You cannot control it sometimes, right? They are the same as you. And when you have these emotions within you, at the end of the day, your emotion is really harmful to you. And then you project it to others, so what you see is that everyone has become like an enemy. Let me tell you a story. A long time back when I was in the UK, a lady came to me and said she had a bad neighbor. Their front yards were joined together, and her neighbor was always making problems for her. He threw garbage into her yard. Whenever she went out he would say something. He was always making problems, and she was very angry. She tried to challenge him, to fight with him, but then the situation got even worse. He became more angry and was making even more problems. Then she thought of maybe calling the police but did not know if she could find enough evidence. She did not know what to do — making a call to the police would also make more problems for her. So she asked me, \"What should I do?\" I told her, \"Maybe you can meditate on compassion. Try to understand that this person is the same as you.\" She said, \"Hmm, compassion does not work. I even asked my neighbor, 'Why do you want to make problems for me?' And he said, 'I just want to make problems.' \" She said, \"He was born no good. By nature, he is no good. Compassion does not work with him.\" And I told her, \"Well, I do not have many more suggestions other than this practice. Maybe you will see what you can do.\" She was a little bit disappointed. And I did not meet her again for one year. The next year she came back to me and said, \"Wow, your advice from last time really worked.\" It had changed her life, and I thought, \"Oh, that was very quick!\" I was surprised, myself, so I asked her, \"How did it help you?\" She said she went back and reflected on what I had told her, and she really tried to practice compassion. When she really practiced compassion, she lost the fear. Before, she had projected onto him that he was really evil, and she had a lot of fear and insecurity. Then she responded and fought back, and they were bound to make a lot of problems for each other. But when she felt compassion, she lost the fear. She became more confident, peaceful, and powerful, and at the same time, softer. And then, whatever he did, in her eyes, was just a simple, small thing. It did not bother her. She walked freely. Then he did things just one or two times, and less and less, until he stopped. A few months later, when she went out, he came out and said, \"Hi,\" [Mingyur Rinpoche smiles and waves] and she said, \"Hi,\" also. And he said, \"Sorry — in the past, I made a lot of trouble for you. Can you forgive me?\" She said, \"Yes, I will forgive you.\" She forgave him, and he was so happy. And the two became very good friends. There was no enemy in the end [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs]. They supported each other, and life was wonderful. Therefore, once we connect with our deeper level, at a fundamental level we are all the same. There is nobody who is born evil. Especially nowadays, there is a lot of scientific research saying that babies have a lot of compassion. In research done on infants who are maybe five or six months old, researchers check the infants' facial expressions and detect how they respond. So there are puppets — a kind puppet, a mean puppet — and almost all of the babies like the kind puppet. And research has shown that if there are two babies, and one of them has cake, and the other one does not, most of the babies — almost 99% — share it. They give it to the other baby. So, at the basic level, we have this compassion. But then we are trapped with the conceptual mind. And then we filter this compassion as egoistic mind. Therefore, try to understand this even with a difficult person and to wish that that difficult person be free from suffering and especially the causes of suffering. The causes of suffering are ignorance, affliction — that difficult person can become more peaceful, more compassionate, and kinder by connecting with wisdom. So that is what we need to practice.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the true enemy is not the one who harms you, but rather their afflictive emotions. Can you explain how this works? Question 2\nIn the story that Mingyur Rinpoche discusses about his friend who is at odds with her neighbor, how does meditation on compassion help her deal with this situation? What effect does it have on her and/or her neighbor? Points to remember:\nWe all possess basic goodness.\nYour true nature can be obscured temporarily by afflictive emotions, but it is never affected in the slightest by these afflictions.\nYour real enemy is not the other, but afflictive emotions both within your mind and in the minds of others.\nThose most deserving of compassion are those who engage in negativity now—they will reap the outcomes of their actions in the future.\nTip\nWhen being harmed, do not focus on the person. Instead, focus on the root of their actions—negative emotions.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nwhy cultivating compassion for those whom you do not like is more challenging\nabout the universality of suffering&nbsp;\nthe benefits of cultivating compassion for difficult people\nabout nurturing healthy relationships Joyful Wisdom, pp. 192–195 (Ch. 9: \"Ordinary Loving-kindness and Compassion: Focusing on Who or What We Don't Like\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.5 Compassion for a Difficult Person Meditation\" data-href=\"2.2.5 Compassion for a Difficult Person Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.5-compassion-for-a-difficult-person-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.5 Compassion For A Difficult Person, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.5 compassion for a difficult person, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.5 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Compassion for a Difficult Person: View (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Compassion_for_a_Difficult_Person_View_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for a Difficult Person: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_a_Difficult_Person_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.5-compassion-for-a-difficult-person-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.5-compassion-for-a-difficult-person-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474817,"modifiedTime":1759272586632,"sourceSize":8636,"sourcePath":"1.

The more mindful you become, the easier you'll find it to be compassionate. And the more you open your heart to others, the more mindful you become in all your activities.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nThe practice of immeasurable compassion in daily life that I want to emphasize here is about dedication.\nYou can begin, in the morning, with the right motivation. We talked about this for the practice of love.\nNow, before you go to sleep, you can dedicate whatever virtuous deeds you did in your life, such as practicing compassion or helping others, the environment, or whoever needs it — whatever virtuous practices.\nThink of those and even happiness. Whatever you experience — happiness, good circumstances that you encounter in your life — you should dedicate to all beings. Dedicate it for world peace, so that the world may be free from natural disasters, war, and monkey-mind problems, and so that, eventually, all beings may recognize their innate compassion and really be free, awakening their fundamental, great qualities. Do that at the end of the day.\nIf you want to dedicate particularly for your friends or family, or for someone who is having a hard time or having problems, you can dedicate particularly for them and then for all beings before you go to sleep. Try that.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesEach night before you go to bed, reflect on the positive deeds you did throughout the day. This could include anything, like helping others, thinking fondly of others, or aspiring to do good deeds. After you bring these virtuous activities to mind, dedicate any positivity that might have come from these deeds to other beings. Think, \"Due to the virtue of my deeds, may all beings everywhere be free from suffering and its causes.\" It is also okay to put special focus on beings in your own life who may be struggling.Journal Reflection QuestionsThis practice can feel out of reach—thinking of beings you do not know. What strategies allow you to connect with all beings? What allows you to open your heart beyond your immediate surroundings?Tip\nDo not feel bad if these practices feel difficult at first.

But when we extend compassion to all beings in our meditations, we may find ourselves floundering a bit. How do I visualize or feel connection with a vast number of living beings that exist at any moment of time, almost all of which are completely unknown to me? Here is an example that may be of help: Let's say that your friends have organized a party for you. Maybe it is your birthday or some other special event. Imagine yourself walking to this party. You do not exactly know who is going to be there, but you feel this sense of warmth, caring, and compassion, as you go, for everyone in the room. You want all of them to be free from suffering. As you walk through the door and enter the room of the party, it does not matter who you see. Your warmth and compassion encompasses them all. So now, think of the world in exactly this way. Right now, for instance, many meditators around the world are sending you compassion. Let your wish that all beings be free from suffering — let that wish be released from the need for specific details about them. Let it become a general attitude that you have towards all beings, an attitude that just permeates your life. They have suffered, are suffering, or will suffer terribly, and you want to relieve that. You wish for them that they find the wisdom to achieve true freedom from suffering. As we do this practice for all beings, many of us find that our typical attitude towards the world changes. As we walk through life or enter any situation, a feeling of warmth, caring, and the wish to help begins to become our knee-jerk reaction. What a wonderful gift it is when this replaces the knee-jerk reaction that is typical — a reaction of maybe fear, anger, discomfort, or shame. May this practice open beautiful doors in your life. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.6 Compassion for All Beings View\" data-href=\"2.2.6 Compassion for All Beings View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.6 Compassion For All Beings, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.6 compassion for all beings, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.6 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Compassion for All Beings (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Compassion_for_All_Beings_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474792,"modifiedTime":1759272586653,"sourceSize":2747,"sourcePath":"1.

But through the practice of tonglen, you open your mind to infinite creatures and wish for their well-being.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow we will practice meditation on immeasurable compassion. Basically, all beings wish to be free from suffering and the causes of suffering, and you can connect with that. Then, how you form this as meditation depends on your personality. You can feel it or label or say it, using phrases like, \"May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" Or imagine it. You can even imagine it with your breathing: take all beings' suffering into yourself so that they all may be free from suffering. It could be something like that.\nWe will try this together. First, rest your mind in open awareness. Just be. What we are experiencing now is awareness, love, and compassion, actually. These three are never separate and always there. Just be with that. [Silent meditation] Now, send your compassion to all beings, to whoever wants to be free from suffering out there. Wish for them all to be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. You can try with phrases: \"May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" [Silent meditation] And you can try with your imagination, with your breath. Take a slow, deep breath in, and take all beings' suffering into yourself as dark light. When you breathe out, send your compassion as a bright light to all beings. The moment you take all beings' suffering into yourself, it automatically transforms into the causes of being free from suffering. It is compassion, it is love, it is virtue. Now this virtue, this compassion, becomes light, and you send it to them. [Silent meditation] Another practice is that you can feel it. Just connect with the basic feeling of all beings. Connect with all beings' compassion.[Silent meditation] Now let your mind just be as it is. Even if you do not particularly meditate on compassion, your mind is always in compassion. So it does not matter. For this genuine compassion, there is no hatred, no \"right,\" no \"wrong.\" 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session To begin, find your meditation posture. Take a moment to arrive and be present in your body.&nbsp;\nNext, rest the mind in open awareness, letting go of any doing, and simply be.&nbsp;\nNow, take a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice In whatever way works for you, connect with the fact that the universe is filled with innumerable beings—different forms of life. Each of these beings experience suffering and the desire to be free from this discomfort. It could be a felt sense or an image that helps you connect with beings. Use whatever strategy is most useful.\nNow, using a phrase that resonates with you, wish that all beings everywhere may be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. Repeat this phrase in your mind.&nbsp;\nAlternatively, you can practice sending and taking. Imagine that as you breathe out, you send well-being and comfort to all beings in the form of white light. And as you breathe in, imagine drawing dark smoke into your heart-center, relieving others from their suffering.&nbsp;\nIt is completely natural to struggle with this practice. If you find it too challenging, simply take a break and let go of the phrases or images. Just rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nWhenever it feels appropriate, once again, bring to mind all beings. Reflect that, just like you, they too wish to be free from suffering and its causes. Use either the phrase or the images as described above.&nbsp; End session Let go of the phrase and images, and simply rest in open awareness. Perhaps there is emotional residue. In any case, just let go, and let be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains three approaches to meditating on compassion for all beings. They are based on the body (feeling love), speech (using phrases), and mind (imagining taking suffering and sending well-being). Which of these approaches feels most accessible to you? Please explain why/how.At the end of the meditation practice, Mingyur Rinpoche explains that even when you are not explicitly meditating on compassion, you always have compassion. How does this affect your relationship with your practice?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.6 Compassion for All Beings Application\" data-href=\"2.2.6 Compassion for All Beings Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.6 Compassion For All Beings, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.6 compassion for all beings, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.6 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Compassion for All Beings: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Compassion_for_All_Beings_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for All Beings: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_All_Beings_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474784,"modifiedTime":1759272586659,"sourceSize":5932,"sourcePath":"1.

Thinking in this way, we make our own problems seem much bigger than they really are.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nhow to cultivate immeasurable compassion\nthe connection among beings\nthe causes of suffering\nthe benefits of practicing compassion for all beings\nWatch Read\nCompassion for all beings is what we call \"immeasurable compassion.\" Now you are really expanding your compassion to all beings. Once you expand your compassion to all beings, then your compassion becomes immeasurable because beings are immeasurable.\nHow to do that? The basic level is the same. Whoever they are, no matter whether they are human or not — a dog, an animal, a bird — they all are looking for something. They want to achieve something. Even ants are busy, busy, busy. They may not have feelings or sensations like we do, but they are looking for something. They are very busy wanting to be free from suffering.&nbsp;\nSuffering does not have to mean pain like for us. It might not be like that, because everybody has different opinions about suffering, different experiences of suffering, and different ways to look at suffering. But on the basic level, it is the same. They want to be free from obstacles, problems.\nActually, we all have this fundamental nature. We, all beings, are part of a big family — on a basic level, we are the same. When you feel that, your compassion becomes very vast.\nOf course, although on the deeper level there is genuine compassion, it is filtered by ignorance. We do not recognize the deeper level of compassion so our minds are fixed, and we have aversion and craving. Then it becomes suffering. It is like holding a hammer in your hand and hitting your head, and then complaining to someone else, \"Hey! Who did that?\" Again you hit yourself and think, \"Oh, this is the second time,\" but it is actually your own hand. We want to be free from suffering, but sometimes we do not know the causes of the suffering. And we create these causes. Not only we create them — from time to time, all beings do that.&nbsp;\nMaybe I will tell you a funny story that I heard a long time ago from a friend of mine. In India, there was a person whose house had two floors, the first or ground floor and the second floor — or whatever you call them, depending on your country. There was a front yard with a big gate, and the neighbor had the same thing — they were together. This neighbor had a dog, a very bad-tempered, big dog. Whenever he went out, the dog would also come out and chase him, bark, and make a lot of noise. Also, when he came in, the dog would chase him and even sometimes come into his home and make noise. He was not happy, and he wanted to fight back and punish this dog. He sometimes tried to hit him, but the dog was very skillful, so he could not hit him.&nbsp;\nHe thought, \"Hmm, how can I punish this dog?\" And one Saturday morning, he came up with a nice plan. His plan was to open the main gate just a little bit and to put a heavy object like a brick on top of the gate. Then, when he opened the window, it would make some noise, and the dog would come and push the gate to get into his house. If the dog pushed this gate, the heavy object would fall on him, so then he would get his punishment. He was so happy with his plan, and he set it up.\nIn the early morning, he went to the second floor, opened the window and said something, and waited for the dog to come. But the dog did not come. So he waited and waited, got bored, and thought, \"Maybe I will do my daily prayer.\" So he set up a table and chair, and he sat and did his daily meditation prayer. He stayed a while doing the prayer and waiting for the dog. The dog still did not come, so he continued to pray. And there is a prayer that we call \"The Four Immeasurables,\" which you have done already: \"May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering\" — something like that. So he was doing this. \"May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness,\" [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to look for the dog] waiting for the dog to come. \"May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering,\" looking for the dog again.\nSuddenly, he thought, \"Oh, wait a minute. What am I saying?\" What he was saying was, \"May all beings be free from suffering,\" but actually he was waiting for this dog to suffer. He thought, \"Oh, I am lying. This is not good. What should I do? Maybe I will stop praying.\" So he stopped, but he felt bad about it because he had been praying this his entire life. Now that he suddenly stopped the prayer, he did not feel good about it. And he thought, \"Maybe I will try to practice compassion with the dog.\" He tried to develop compassion. \"That dog is the same as me. May he be free from suffering — no, no, no, this dog deserves suffering.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] He did not want to practice this with the dog.&nbsp;\nHe thought, \"What should I do?\" Finally, he came up with another idea. The idea was to change the prayer a little bit. So then the prayer became: \"May some sentient beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\" He thought, \"Oh, that is nice\" because the dog was not included. \"May some sentient beings have happiness and the causes of happiness.\" He continued praying and finished his daily practice, and the dog still did not come.&nbsp;\nThen he thought, \"I should eat breakfast.\" He ate breakfast and cleaned his house, and he made lunch. In the afternoon, around 3 p.m., he got tired and fell asleep. He woke up after that and thought, \"Oh, I spent the whole day in my house. Now I should take a walk.\" So he went down, opened the gate, looked, and boom! The heavy object fell on the top of his head. He suddenly saw galaxies and stars without the need of a telescope. And he thought, \"Wow! This is very quick karma!\" In the morning, he had wanted to harm the dog, and now the result came back to him.\nSo he thought, \"Okay, now I really want to try to practice compassion for all beings, including the dog.\" He really practiced. The next morning, when he went out, he practiced this again, and he brought what we call \"tsamba,\" a barley flour to make dough. It is edible — a Tibetan food. When the dog came, he gave it to him and said, \"May all beings be free from suffering.\" The dog barked at first but then ate the food. And when he came back, he tried this again. And slowly the dog started to move his tail, not barking much. And slowly, slowly, the dog stopped barking [Mingyur Rinpoche mimics a dog panting]. Instead, he was waiting for him. Then, in the end, the two became very good friends. The dog liked him, he loved the dog, and the problem was solved. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nRegarding when we really practice connecting with compassion for all beings, sometimes we say, \"Love and compassion are more powerful than an atom bomb.\" It is really powerful. At the same time, it is there but invisible, so we may not feel it or connect with it. Therefore, send your compassion to all beings and wish that all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering. This will be immeasurable compassion.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWhen Mingyur Rinpoche explains that compassion is more powerful than an atomic bomb, what does he mean? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche says that suffering is like holding a hammer, hitting yourself in the head, and then asking what happened. How would you explain this simile to a friend? Points to remember:\nYou cultivate compassion for all beings by recognizing the universal wish to be free from suffering.\nAll beings are interconnected.\nSuffering is caused by ignorance—the temporary obscuration of your true nature.\nPracticing compassion for all beings is more powerful than an atom bomb.\nInquiry\nAre you able to see through obscurations and suffering to see others' true nature?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nthe benefits of meditating on compassion for all beings\nabout the traditional Tibetan sending and taking (tonglen) practice\ntips for connecting to beings whom you will never be able to know\nhow meditating on compassion helps to calm your mind Joyful Wisdom, pp. 195–197 (Ch. 9: \"Immeasurable Loving-kindness/Compassion\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.2.6 Compassion for All Beings Meditation\" data-href=\"2.2.6 Compassion for All Beings Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.2.6 Compassion For All Beings, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.2.6 compassion for all beings, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.2.6 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Compassion for All Beings: View (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Compassion_for_All_Beings_View_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Compassion for All Beings: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Compassion_for_All_Beings_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.2/2.2.6-compassion-for-all-beings-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800474762,"modifiedTime":1759272586675,"sourceSize":9348,"sourcePath":"1.

What I am noticing is just how aware I have become of how I redirect my mind. What I mean with that is that, when I notice myself comparing myself to somebody, I am much more likely to stop and say, \"Hey, I am comparing myself. Can I rejoice in their uniqueness or in their talents?\" Or if somebody is succeeding with something, \"Instead of just witnessing their success, can I rejoice in it?\"\nI notice that this takes a little bit of effort on my part. I am choosing joy here. I am choosing the practice of joy. What I can say is I have found that the benefits have been almost instantaneous because it is very difficult to hold a negative mindset when one is practicing joy. I hope you have found these practices rewarding as well.\nThe next section that Mingyur Rinpoche is going to introduce us to is on the fourth immeasurable, equanimity. If this were baseball, equanimity is like the heavy hitter. It is the one you want to have on hand for the home run. You see, love, compassion, and joy need equanimity in order to fully blaze in their splendor. So, we are looking forward to some wonderful teachings on equanimity.\nAnd just to close, it has been a real joy having you in this course!&nbsp;\nThank you so much, and I wish you all the best in your practice! Conclusion by Edwin Kelley\n[no video available]\nRead\nI hope you have enjoyed this course on practicing joy for oneself and others. I think the big takeaway for me from practicing joy was to understand that we are all endowed with this basic goodness, this true nature. And it expresses itself in myriad little ways both within ourselves and within others all the time, but we are so prone to taking it for granted. We just do not notice it, or, when it happens, we dismiss it in some way.\nIn practicing joy, it is really a focus on recognizing when our true nature expresses itself — either through kindness, awareness, wisdom, capability, compassion, or any skill or quality that defines who we are and the uniqueness of our individual personality — and when we see this, when we recognize this, to rejoice in it, to appreciate it, and to be grateful for this. This can be something we can do in everyday life, when somebody opens a door for us when we enter a building or when somebody lets us merge in the traffic. In those moments, if we connect to this joy, this gratitude, for what just happened or what just took place and recognize this goodness in beings in the world that surrounds us, then it qualitatively changes our experience. Our life just becomes more joyful and happier. There is a way in which we are tuned in to the wonderful nature of human beings. And our life then is qualitatively transformed.\nI encourage you to recognize these wonderful qualities in yourself and others — in all sentient life — wherever you can. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4 Transformation and Equanimity\" data-href=\"2.4 Transformation and Equanimity\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4-transformation-and-equanimity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Go to Next Course →</a>","aliases":["2.3 Joy, Conclusion - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3 joy, conclusion - Tergar joy of living course","2.3 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4-transformation-and-equanimity.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3-joy-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475236,"modifiedTime":1759272586687,"sourceSize":3549,"sourcePath":"1.

While practicing in Burma he ordained temporarily as a Theravada Buddhist monk.\nIn 1994 he was hired as Director of Operations by one of America's best known meditation retreat centers, the Insight Meditation Society (IMS), in Barre, MA. Eighteen months later he was appointed Executive Director of IMS and served in that capacity until 2003 when he resigned to pursue further long-term intensive meditation practice.\nEdwin first encountered Vajrayana Buddhism in Dharamsala, India in 1993 and became a student of Mingyur Rinpoche in 1998. He has a post graduate diploma in Buddhist Studies from the University of Sunderland in the UK. He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota with his wife Myoshin in 2009 to help establish the global Tergar Meditation Community.

The basic thing is to recognize that these great qualities are there with us all the time. Do you remember? Love, compassion, awareness, wisdom, capabilities, and skills, all these are there, but we do not recognize them. The joy practice really helps give us another perspective in order to recognize these fundamental qualities within all of us.\nFrom today on, every day, write down five things you appreciate. You could start by writing down five things that you appreciate about the world in general.\nIn general, the world is very peaceful, right now. We have the lowest rate of violence in all of human history, some scientists say. You can appreciate that. And appreciate that Mother Earth is amazing, that the Earth accommodates us all. We are alive because of the Earth. We are getting all these things — food, water, oxygen, everything — because of the Earth. Appreciate that.\nThink of five things that you appreciate and write them down today. Or it could be in these coming days or tomorrow. Some of you may be watching this video before you go to sleep, and you might say, \"Today? I am going to sleep now.\" Maybe you can appreciate that this world has allowed you to have your house and your life and that you are able to sleep. You can appreciate that too.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesThe world provides us with this life—it produces the oxygen we breathe, the materials we use to build our homes, the food we eat, and so on. As you begin each day, take a few minutes to reflect on and write down five things that you appreciate.Journal Reflection QuestionsAs you recognize all there is to appreciate in your life, does this help you connect with your basic goodness?

And so, this practice is really equipping us with the skill that, when we see or recognize an expression of our true nature, we take a moment to rejoice, celebrate, appreciate, and are grateful for being endowed with our true nature and for recognizing the way it expresses itself, both in ourselves and in others. And the reason for this is that this is where we derive true happiness. This is where we connect to this enduring, inner happiness that connects with our true nature.\nThank you for joining us! <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.1 Basic Goodness and Joy View\" data-href=\"2.3.1 Basic Goodness and Joy View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.1-basic-goodness-and-joy-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.1 Basic Goodness And Joy, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.1 basic goodness and joy, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.1 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Basic Goodness and Joy (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Basic_Goodness_and_Joy_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.1-basic-goodness-and-joy-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.1-basic-goodness-and-joy-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475230,"modifiedTime":1759272586713,"sourceSize":2150,"sourcePath":"1.

This awareness is full of qualities — love, compassion, and wisdom. Just be with it. Whether you feel it or not does not matter.&nbsp;\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please close your eyes, and, in particular, look for or feel appreciation for having great qualities within yourself.

Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be just as it is. There is no need to follow any experiences or try to block them. Just let everything be, and rest in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Reflect on how all beings have this fundamental nature that is pure and pristine, imbued with the qualities of love, compassion, wisdom, and awareness.&nbsp;\nAs you recognize these qualities and capacities in yourself and others, seeing how they manifest uniquely in all beings, simply appreciate that this is, in fact, what is true. Appreciate awareness itself that knows these qualities. Appreciate how you are naturally wise.&nbsp;\nPeriodically, let go of this practice and take a few moments to rest in open awareness. Allow the mind to relax. As you feel ready, you can return to the practice and again cultivate a sense of appreciation.&nbsp;\nRemember, when you get lost in thought, simply recognize that you are lost, rejoice that you have again become aware, and continue your practice.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone.

Of course, for it to be immeasurable, we have to practice step-by-step. Do you remember that there are four immeasurables? Immeasurable love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. Now, we will practice joy.\nWhat is joy? \"Joy\" means \"happiness,\" \"contentment,\" \"appreciation,\" and \"gratitude.\" Suffering, as you know, is called \"dukkha.\" The real translation of dukkha is \"dissatisfaction,\" it is never enough. There is a feeling of insecurity, incompleteness, something missing, something not being right, loneliness, or sadness. These are dukkha. And when dukkha becomes stronger, then you always want more and more and cannot get it, and then you hate and you crave, and you are confused. There are a lot of problems.\nHow to be free from dukkha? One of the best practices is the practice of joy. What is the practice of joy? It is appreciation and gratitude. I heard about a lot of research being done around happiness. In a company, if you are getting a salary that is a little bit higher than everyone else in the company, you feel very happy. It does not matter if it is $1000, $4000, or $70,000 every month. It does not matter.\nAnother example is that in my hometown, people were quite happy. When they had enough food, clothing, and a little bit of extra money, they felt very happy. Life in my hometown was very simple in the past, and people were really social and helped each other. They had a lot of fun and parties, and it was quite good. But now, as things have become more and more developed, my hometown is much more developed compared to when I was young, and they are no longer so happy. The satisfaction is gone now, and everybody is in competition: \"Oh, they have a nice house, so I need a nice house,\" or \"They have a new business, so I need to have a new business.\" So it does not matter how much you develop materially.\nThere is a couple that I met. They said their lives were wonderful — they were both very smart, they were both working at a good company, getting nice salaries, and they were very happy. They had a house and cars, and life was wonderful. They were very happy. And one day they had a discussion. They thought, \"Our life is quite good. Maybe we should buy a new, more expensive house, in a richer area of the city.\" They decided to buy an expensive house, in a richer and luxurious area. They moved there, and at first they were very happy. Wherever they looked, right and left, all of their neighbors had big houses, big cars, and fancy clothes. But when they looked at their own car, they thought, \"Our car is not enough,\" and they bought another big car. Then they looked at their neighbors again and saw they had nice and fancy clothes that they did not have. Because of these comparisons, they slowly became very stressed and unhappy, and they argued a lot. At work, they were not happy anymore either. In the end, they had a discussion and thought, \"Why, the moment we moved here, did our lives go downhill?\" They searched for the reason, and then the wife said, \"Maybe it is because of the neighbors.\" And what they found was that because they were looking right and left, in competition, they were not satisfied with what they had. They were not appreciating or rejoicing in what they had. Every day they were competing with their neighbors. They became very stressed, and that is why their job quality, health, and family relationships were not good either. The moment they saw this, they let go. They began to appreciate what they had. They changed the quality of their lives after that. I thought this was a very nice story.\nSometimes when I try to practice appreciation, I also look for very special things to appreciate. But actually, that is not necessary. Like now, you are alive, and that is amazing, right? You have this breathing — it is magical. Breathe in, breathe out. You have these wonderful eyes, ears, and nose, and you can see wonderful things around you.\nSometimes, when I give teachings, I drink a lot of water. I teach for about two hours, drinking water again and again. At the end of the session, my lower abdomen is full of water. I really want to go to the restroom. In my mind, I am thinking about the restroom. What I do is ask, \"Now, does anyone have any questions? If there are no questions, then I want to go.\" And all of a sudden someone raises their hand and asks something like, \"What is the meaning of life?\" They ask a very complicated question. I give a very simple answer — \"The meaning of life is something like...\" [Mingyur Rinpoche smiles as if to bring closure to the topic] — and I think we are finished. But that simple answer creates another question. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But in my mind I really want to go to the restroom. Finally, I say that it is finished and the time is up. And I go to the restroom. After using the restroom, life is wonderful! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You feel really relieved and happy, and when you look around it feels like you are on a different planet. But normally, we do not appreciate that. Do you have this problem now? The \"lower abdomen\" problem? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I do not think you have this problem, right now. But you do not appreciate that freedom.\nThere is no need to appreciate big things. Normally, what we think of as \"big things\" may not be big things. What we normally think of as \"small things\" are the big things. You can just appreciate those. They may seem like small things but are actually big ones.\nAppreciation really becomes a cause of joy. Then, when you practice that, what happens is that you will discover a lot of great things within you, within others, and about the world. It is almost like you are finding new qualities within you. They are there from the beginning, but when you do not recognize them, then they are hidden from you. But when you practice joy, you discover this. Then it seems as if you transform and get new, great qualities. This is a really great practice.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche discusses the transformation that occurs in his hometown in rural Nepal as technology and other elements of modernity arrive. In particular, he shares how the general orientation of local people shifts from contentment and appreciation to competitiveness and a feeling of missing out. If you were to explain this transition—particularly how it connects to appreciation—to a friend, how would you do so?\nPoints to remember:\nJoy = happiness and contentment.\nJoy is experienced through appreciation and gratitude.\nJoy is experienced through letting go of expectations and comparison.\nThrough the practice of joy, you will find qualities within yourself that you had not recognized before.\nTip\nAwareness, love, compassion, and joy are with you and other beings all the time. Just rest the mind and allow this reality to emerge.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow appreciation is involved in cultivating joy\nabout craving and its role in unhappiness\nabout identifying the causes of happiness\nabout temporary versus lasting happiness The Joy of Living, pp. 110–112 (Ch. 8: \"Why Are We Unhappy?\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.1 Basic Goodness and Joy Meditation\" data-href=\"2.3.1 Basic Goodness and Joy Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.1-basic-goodness-and-joy-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.1 Basic Goodness And Joy, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.1 basic goodness and joy, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.1 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Basic Goodness and Joy: View (9 min)","level":2,"id":"Basic_Goodness_and_Joy_View_(9_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Basic Goodness and Joy: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Basic_Goodness_and_Joy_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.1-basic-goodness-and-joy-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.1-basic-goodness-and-joy-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475212,"modifiedTime":1759272586734,"sourceSize":8408,"sourcePath":"1.

As soon as you wake up in the morning, just appreciate that you are alive. Appreciate that you are breathing. Appreciate that there is a sun. There is air. There is an Earth.\nWhen you get out of bed — when your feet touch the ground — appreciate that there is a ground. Appreciate that you are able to feel sensations, also. When you are taking a shower, appreciate the water. Then appreciate breakfast — the food. Appreciate that you are able to taste it.\nWhen you go out, open your door and look. The neighbors. The mountains. The trees. Wow! The trees are amazing, aren't they? The sun, the moon, the clouds. While you are walking, appreciate that you have this body and that you can hear the sounds around you.\nYou can write down five things to appreciate about yourself and what is around you. Maybe if you are doing this for a few days, one day you can focus on different parts of your body or the senses and write it down. The next day you can focus more on what is around you. Continue like that.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesEach morning when you wake up, reflect on how lucky you are to be alive. Consider the fact that there is air to breathe, a sun to warm the earth, ground to walk on, loved ones to care about, and so on. Each day, find a time—perhaps just after waking up—and write down five things that you are grateful for. Try rotating the focus of your appreciation. For example, you could reflect on your physical body on day one, your surroundings on day two, your friends and family on day three, and so on.Journal Reflection Questions\nEvery component of your life is imbued with things to be grateful for. And whether or not you are aware of this fact can drastically influence your experience.

Here we are talking about joy and the practice of joy for ourselves.\nIt is interesting, isn't it, that sometimes the starting point is the most difficult place of all. Here we are where we are looking at ourselves. My question to you is: How many of you tend to forget to appreciate yourself? How many of you tend to take yourself for granted? How many of you tend to take the things you do for granted? It is possible, it is likely, that many of us share this issue of forgetting to appreciate ourselves, and so, here Mingyur Rinpoche is turning the table, and he is asking us to have a look and develop a new, gentle, tender relationship with ourselves.\nI actually find that the practice of appreciation comes a little bit easier than the ones of loving-kindness and compassion. I find it is easier to say I appreciate XYZ about myself. In that way, I find that the practice of joy becomes a stepping stone to the pathway of our basic goodness.\nI also found that in one of the exercises that Mingyur Rinpoche gave us, he asks us to make a list of things that we appreciate about ourselves. I remember I was listing, \"I am conscientious, and I am a decent writer...\" and you know, those things are great, and they are important. But I also noticed that, in this exercise, Mingyur Rinpoche was bringing notice or attention to the abilities and capacities that we have that are not necessarily related to our doing, such as our eyesight and our hearing. Just recently I had a migraine, and I could not see or work. And I thought, \"Wow! Do I ever appreciate my eyesight, and wow, do I ever take it for granted.\"\nWhat I learned doing those exercises is that, whether we are doing something or whether we are being, there is always something that we can appreciate.\nI look forward to sharing these practices with you and seeing you in the forum.&nbsp;\nSee you soon! <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.2 Joy for Oneself View\" data-href=\"2.3.2 Joy for Oneself View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.2 Joy For Oneself, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.2 joy for oneself, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Joy for Oneself (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Joy_for_Oneself_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475192,"modifiedTime":1759272586753,"sourceSize":2551,"sourcePath":"1.

Keep your meditation posture, and first rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please be aware of breathing. Breathing in, breathing out. Appreciate that you can breathe. It is so wonderful. You are taking in oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide. It is like a miracle.&nbsp;\nBreathing is connecting with your entire body. You are alive now. How wonderful!\nAppreciate that you are alive.\nAppreciate that you have senses. Your wonderful eyes can see things. Your ears can hear. Your nose can smell. Your tongue can taste wonderful varieties of food. Appreciate the senses and the body. Feel the sensations.\nThen you have this wonderful awareness. It is always there with you, illuminating. Awareness is in union with love, compassion, and wisdom — such wonderful qualities. Who you are is wonderful. You need to recognize how wonderful your nature is.\n[Silent meditation]\nOf course, whether you believe it or not, gravity is always there. Is the same thing here — whether you feel it or not, or believe it or not — these great qualities are with us all the time. Appreciate and be thankful for these qualities.\nEven if you feel you cannot connect with this, even if you feel you cannot recognize this, this feeling of not recognizing is also a manifestation of your great qualities, your basic goodness.\nJust wanting to connect with your innate qualities is wonderful. Right now, the fact that you are keeping your meditation posture, watching this video, listening to my talk, and trying to feel this basic goodness is wonderful! You are full of kindness, care, and compassion for yourself. Appreciate this — feel gratitude.\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be just as it is. There is no need to follow any experiences or try to block them. Just let everything be, and rest in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Notice how, from your breath to your subtle movements, your body supports all of your activities. Give rise to appreciation for this fundamental fact.&nbsp;\nMany of us tend toward noticing our flaws and shortcomings. Here, however, we are recognizing what is right and good within our experience. Cultivate a sense of appreciation for the fact that you are alive in this moment.&nbsp;\nYou can bring this same sense of gratitude to your senses. Notice what you hear in this present moment. You can appreciate the subtle texture and details of these sounds.&nbsp;\nNow, slowly open your eyes. Take a moment to look around. Notice some of the small details that you might typically miss. Appreciate all of these things that are in your environment at this moment. Appreciate the simple fact that you are here to witness all of these things.\nNext, slowly close your eyes. You may experience seeing colors and images, even with your eyes closed, or it may be completely dark. Simply appreciate that you are experiencing whatever is present.&nbsp;\nTake a few moments to appreciate the fact that you have awareness in each and every moment of your life.&nbsp;\nThere is no need to restrain the mind. Simply notice what you are aware of, and appreciate that awareness allows you to experience it.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Does your experience change when you bring your awareness to the good qualities—like love, compassion, joy, and wisdom—that are within you?When you are aware of the breath, sounds, forms, sensations, and so on during this type of practice, does your experience change?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.2 Joy for Oneself Application\" data-href=\"2.3.2 Joy for Oneself Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.2 Joy For Oneself, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.2 joy for oneself, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.2 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for Oneself: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_Oneself_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for Oneself: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_Oneself_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475184,"modifiedTime":1759272586761,"sourceSize":5527,"sourcePath":"1.

Here, again, we have five steps, like with loving-kindness and compassion. The idea is to start with the easiest step. For some people, beginning with oneself is easiest, and for others, beginning with someone they like is easiest, it depends. The structure is to begin with oneself.&nbsp;\nThe practice of joy means to appreciate, have gratitude, and feel happy about what you have. When you appreciate more and more, then you will discover your innate, original qualities, step by step. In the beginning, you may think, \"Where? I cannot find any object of joy.\" You may write down one or two things and then run out ideas. But eventually, five will not be enough.\nLet me tell you a story. While I was on my wandering retreat, someone gave me a tent. I was so happy. Some tourists who went to the mountain to hike were on their way back while I was going up. We had a conversation, and they gave me their tent. I thought, \"Now I can go anywhere. There is no need to look for a cave because I have this tent.\" There was a small village there, and one morning I walked out of the village and went to the mountain. There was a nice place not very far from a creek and some dry woods. It was a nice place. I was going to practice meditation there for a few weeks, and I had some food with me. After a few weeks, all the food was gone. Normally, there was almost like a miracle — just when I had almost finished my food, and thought, \"What should I eat tomorrow?\" something happened, and people gave me food. So I was waiting for that miracle to happen. But no food came. And I waited and waited the whole next day, and nothing happened. No food. I just drank water. The next morning, I also waited until lunch, and nothing happened. By then, I was really hungry. So I packed the tent and went down to the village, and when I reached the village, most of it was closed. In the Himalayas, normally they close very early. Shops, houses, and everything opens very early, but at night they also close early. In the middle of the village was a walking path, and there was a shop on the other side where I had eaten before. I went there, but they were closed. They only had bottles of water. So I got a bottle of water.\nOn the other side of the path was a small lodge, like a hotel, with four beds to a room, where many people stayed. I stayed there, and as I was really hungry. I asked the owner, \"Do you have anything to eat? I am quite hungry.\" The owner said, \"Oh, I have tsampa.\" Tsampa is a kind of Tibetan food, like ground barley flour, and it is roasted. I was very happy. When they gave me the tsampa, I mixed it with my water. Normally, tsampa is mixed with salt and dry cheese and enjoyed with Tibetan tea, and then you eat quite a nice meal. But that time, there was nothing — no salt, no butter, no Tibetan tea — just water mixed with tsampa. But that tsampa was so nice, so tasty! It tasted like butter, even like meat, and it was sweet. It had multiple tastes, so nice. I was very happy, and I finished the tsampa and then had a nice sleep.\nThe next morning I woke up and the shop was open. I went there and ordered instant noodles. In Nepal, there are instant noodles. I ordered a big cup of instant noodles. I ate them and wow, nice! I was really happy and rejoiced and appreciated it. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] At lunchtime, now that I thought that I had the best tsampa in the world, I decided, \"I am going to have tsampa.\" I put the tsampa in a cup, added water, and wow! ...It tasted terrible. There was no salt, no cheese, and no Tibetan tea. Because I had been very hungry the day before and could not have food, I felt so much appreciation for that tsampa, and it tasted wonderful. But the next day I had the instant noodles, and then I was so full that I was not appreciative of the tsampa. I did not feel that it was nice.&nbsp;\nThere are a lot of things in our lives that we take for granted. It is really important to appreciate and see these things. Now, you are looking at me. You have eyes to watch my video with, and you have nice ears to hear my voice. I do not mean that I am nice. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] These eyes and ears are wonderful. You can see nice mountains around you, but if you do not appreciate that you have eyes to see this wonderful mountain, even if the mountain is there, you will not appreciate it. You will not see the real mountain. You will just see your conceptual mountain. So just connect with that. You have your nose, tongue, body, and consciousness; and we have talked about awareness, compassion, and wisdom. We discussed that a lot in the past. You are breathing, and you are alive! Wonderful. Appreciate that about yourself. Begin with yourself. That is really important!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nWhen Mingyur Rinpoche recaps the story from his wandering retreat, he explains two instances in which he ate identical meals (of traditional Tibetan tsampa). Yet, in each instance his internal reaction was quite different. The first time, the food was delicious, whereas the second time, it tasted bland and unappetizing. He attributes this to his hunger. How does this connect to the topic of joy, particularly with respect to appreciation and gratitude? Moreover, how could this example influence how you live your life?\nPoints to remember:\nYou begin the practice of joy with yourself.\nThe essence of joy is cultivating appreciation and gratitude.&nbsp;\nEven your breath, sight, hearing, etc., are deserving of your appreciation.\nThrough cultivating appreciation and gratitude, you will more easily recognize your basic goodness.\nInquiry\nWhat is present in your experience right now that you can be grateful for?\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nthe role of awareness in cultivating appreciation\nhow accessing a single moment of joy can serve as a launching pad for creating continuity\nthe power of short moments of practice, repeated many times Joyful Wisdom, pp. 187–189 (Ch. 9: \"Ordinary Loving-kindness/Compassion: Focusing on Ourselves\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.2 Joy for Oneself Meditation\" data-href=\"2.3.2 Joy for Oneself Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.2 Joy For Oneself, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.2 joy for oneself, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for Oneself: View (7 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_Oneself_View_(7_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for Oneself: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_Oneself_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.2-joy-for-oneself-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475169,"modifiedTime":1759272586779,"sourceSize":7182,"sourcePath":"1.

They may be somebody who cared for us, somebody who raised us, or a teacher who has shared great wisdom with us or taught us a skill. They might be a friend we met along the way who we share a lot in common with. It might be a life partner who has been there for us through difficult times and good times. And so, it is very easy for us to see the way this individual's capabilities naturally express themselves, and that makes it very easy for us then to appreciate these qualities, to rejoice in the fact that this being exhibits these wonderful qualities.\nAnd so, this is what we do in this practice. We connect to the ways in which this individual expresses their capabilities and qualities, the reasons why we love them, or why they are dear to us. We wish for their good fortune and for their qualities to endure, to continue.

Normally, to practice joy means that you feel happy about whatever happiness and virtues that being possesses. You are very happy about that, you appreciate it, and you wish that they continue to be happy that way.\nOr you are happy because that person has freedom. She or he is free from problems, obstacles, or pain. Joy is almost a combination of love and compassion. Compassion is the wish to be free from suffering, and love is the wish to be happy. Now, joy is to appreciate whatever ways other beings are already free from suffering, be happy about that, and wish that it continues being that way. And if the person already has happiness, you are happy about that and wish that it continues being that way. That is the meditation here.&nbsp;\nNow, we are going to practice it together. Please keep your meditation posture, and rest your mind in open awareness. It does not matter if your eyes are closed or open.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, think of a person you love, and feel happy about their happiness, virtue, and good qualities. Appreciate that.\nAnd thank that person, also. You have such a wonderful person in your life. Thank that person.\n[Silent meditation]\nAlso, appreciate the freedom of that person. Feel happy about the happiness of being free from suffering and obstacles, and wish that they continue to be free like that.\n[Silent meditation]\nYou can use a phrase if you want: \"May you continue to be happy and free from suffering.\"\nAnd if you like, you can use the breath. When you breathe out, you feel happy about the happiness and virtue of that person. When you breathe in, you can feel happy about the freedom of that person.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay, now rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation] 20 minutes of formal mediation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session As you begin, find a comfortable posture. Your spine is upright and your muscles are relaxed and at ease.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest the mind in open awareness, letting everything be just as it is. There is no need to do anything or fabricate any state. Just rest.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind a loved one: get a visual image and/or felt sense of this person. Use whatever way helps you connect with them.&nbsp;\nThen, turn your attention toward the fact that this person has the qualities of love, compassion, wisdom, and awareness. Rejoice that these qualities express themselves through this person. Consider the moments of happiness this person experiences.&nbsp;\nIn order to sustain this felt sense of rejoicing, you can recite phrases in your mind, wishing that this person's happiness and freedom from suffering continue. You may say, \"May your happiness and freedom from suffering be never-ending.\"&nbsp;\nAs you engage in this practice, periodically bring to mind memories of this person being happy and/or being relieved from suffering. Allow the appreciation and gratitude to take root in your body.&nbsp;\nPeriodically, allow yourself to rest in open awareness, allowing the mind to relax. As it feels appropriate, come back to the practice described above and continue to cultivate joy.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the phrase and images, and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing and just be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. As you bring to mind the happiness, well-being, and virtue of your loved one, does it affect your lived experience? Similarly, as you reflect on the ways they are free from suffering, does it change your experience? If so, please explain.Mingyur Rinpoche says that joy is the combination of love and compassion, as it includes the wish to be happy and to be free from suffering. How does this affect your experience in meditation? Are you able to hold both of these wishes in your mind while you meditate?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Tip\nWhen you feel jealousy, let that jealousy become the reminder for rejoicing.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.3 Joy for a Loved One Application\" data-href=\"2.3.3 Joy for a Loved One Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.3-joy-for-a-loved-one-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.3 Joy For A Loved One, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.3 joy for a loved one, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.3 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for a Loved One: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_a_Loved_One_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love for a Loved One: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_for_a_Loved_One_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.3-joy-for-a-loved-one-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.3-joy-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475146,"modifiedTime":1759272586808,"sourceSize":5618,"sourcePath":"1.

And who are your loved ones? They are people you like, the same as with the loving-kindness and compassion practice. Now, this practice is to appreciate the good qualities, happiness, joy, success, and virtue of your loved ones. Appreciate and rejoice about it. Feel happy about it. This is really important!\nWhen we really rejoice, when we feel happy about others' happiness, good qualities, and virtues, that joy and happiness make you happy also.\nBut if everything is about you, and you do not want to appreciate the happiness or virtue of others, and you want all the happiness to belong to you, then you will actually not be happy; others' happiness will become a cause of suffering for you.\nBut if you rejoice in others' happiness, it is like you \"buy one and get one free.\" You rejoice in your friends' and family's happiness and success, so that makes them happy. And you are very happy, too — their happiness becomes a cause of happiness for you. In the end, everybody wins. And this really helps the relationships between you and your friends, family, coworkers, and loved ones.\nOften, the conflict between you and your loved ones is jealousy. When it comes to people you do not know, strangers, you do not feel jealous. With people who are already greater than you, you do not feel jealousy either. But if there are people who are similar to you, who you like, and they get something better than you, then you feel really unhappy and sometimes cannot sleep at night.\nFor example, if you win the lottery and have to share it with everybody who bought this lottery ticket with you, then you think, \"Oops, I should have bought it by myself!\" This is our tendency, right? Our unhealthy sense of self is always taking for itself. But actually, if you share, if you have something and give it away, you really feel deep satisfaction. You can try this next time.\nActually, helping others by giving something away is — for the unhealthy sense of self — breaking the rules. You are breaking the rules of the unhealthy sense of self. The unhealthy sense of self is always thinking about itself. \"I have to win. What about me?\" But if you follow that, it will not really make you deeply happy.\nIf you really help others and work with compassion and love, then you really feel a deep level of satisfaction and happiness. Because that is who you are. That is the healthy sense of who you are. Therefore, feeling gratitude, rejoicing, and appreciation about the qualities, good things, and virtue within your loved ones is really important.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that through rejoicing in the well-being of others, you too will experience happiness. How would you explain this to a friend? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche says satisfaction comes from letting go. What do you think he means by this? Points to remember:\nMeditating on joy for a loved one is the second step in the process.\nThrough rejoicing in the virtues and well-being of others, you too will experience happiness.\nThe root of most problems with loved ones is jealousy and envy.\nThrough letting go of self-centered thinking, you will experience satisfaction.\nTip\nOthers' happiness will not detract from your own.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow rejoicing in others' virtue challenges human instincts\nthat success does not necessarily lead to fulfillment\nhow perspective can often enhance experience\nhow taking a step back can be useful when you are struggling Joyful Wisdom, pp. 96-98 (Ch. 4: \"Seeing the Good\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.3 Joy for a Loved One Meditation\" data-href=\"2.3.3 Joy for a Loved One Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.3-joy-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.3 Joy For A Loved One, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.3 joy for a loved one, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for a Loved One: View (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_a_Loved_One_View_(5_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for a Loved One: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_a_Loved_One_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.3-joy-for-a-loved-one-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.3-joy-for-a-loved-one-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475132,"modifiedTime":1759272586822,"sourceSize":4800,"sourcePath":"1.

Now, when you go out and see the shops and the roads, all this is interconnected, right? Without others, you cannot survive in this world. You have survived until now because of help from others, like your parents, family, colleagues, and teachers. If you go to work and there is no company, you cannot work. Even if you have money, you have to have a shop. Without a shop, you cannot buy anything. Also, the roads have to be made by someone, and food comes from farmers.\nAll of this is interdependent. Normally, we never appreciate these things, and we are never thankful for them. So just appreciate them.\nWhen you go to your workplace, maybe you will see some colleagues who are normally there helping each other, whom you do not pay so much attention to. Maybe just bring some special attention to them and thank them. Communicate with them. Or notice those who are normally helping you in the background or not so visibly. You can thank them and appreciate them.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the beginning of each day, take a few moments to set the intention to recognize the profound interconnectedness that exists between you and others. It may be useful to focus on one aspect of your life, or perhaps you prefer to be more generally aware of this fact. Choose the form that feels most supportive to you and periodically stop and recognize that without others, most elements of your life would not function. In other words, if it weren't for others, you would actually not survive.Journal Reflection QuestionsIt is easy to go about your daily life without recognizing the interdependent nature of everything you encounter. In this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche gives a variety of examples of essential aspects of life that depend completely on the efforts of others, such as roadways, food production, etc. What is an area of your life in which you can see this most apparently?

Here we are talking about the neutral person, and I thought I would share a little story. I live at my sister's place, and outside of her home is a little library — I mean a small library — sort of like a birdhouse, except that there are about twenty to twenty-five books in there. Every day, people come to this library, and they take a book or bring a book. And it has become a real source of joy, this nice little exchange in the neighborhood. What has been interesting for me as I have been thinking about Mingyur Rinpoche's teachings is that, in the distance, the people on the sidewalk are strangers; I barely notice them. But once they get a little bit closer to the library, I begin to think about them. I wonder what book they brought or which book they are going to take. And then, as I watch them studying the books that they are going to pick, I think, \"Oh, okay. This person likes such and such a type of book,\" or \"Oh, look! This person has brought five books, wow! I wonder what genre it is.\" As I begin to think about these people, they suddenly do not seem like strangers anymore. There has been this familiarization process that has happened in my mind, and it simply has to do with their connection to this little library. Whereas it was somebody I did not notice before, suddenly I am paying attention with warmth and curiosity. I notice how quickly that happened — this transition from them not being anybody to suddenly registering in my mind.\nI think it is interesting because Mingyur Rinpoche's teachings are all about making other people visible. And here, this little library is showing me how sometimes it just takes one thing to be that bridge into getting to know somebody a little bit or connecting with them. Then the process becomes so easy, and our hearts just naturally tend to open towards them.\nI look forward to hearing about what you think of these teachings and how you respond to them in the forum.&nbsp;\nSee you soon! <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.4 Joy for a Neutral Person View\" data-href=\"2.3.4 Joy for a Neutral Person View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.4 Joy For A Neutral Person, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.4 joy for a neutral person, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Joy for a Neutral Person (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Joy_for_a_Neutral_Person_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475121,"modifiedTime":1759272586843,"sourceSize":2663,"sourcePath":"1.

Just a neutral person. Actually, this neutral person has basic goodness, just like you.\nYou have a lot of great things, and you admire your loved ones, right? You normally think, \"They are great and nice. I love them.\" Maybe you are inspired by that person, but for someone else, they might be the worst person in the world.\nTherefore, everybody has their unique things like qualities, talents, wisdom, capacities, and a unique way of living life also. Just pick a random person, and appreciate these things. Feel happy about whatever that person has — happiness, well-being, and freedom.\nWe are going to practice this together. Now, please keep your meditation posture. Rest your mind in open awareness for a while.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please think of that being in your mind. Appreciate the great qualities they have, and feel happy about their happiness and freedom.\n[Silent meditation]\nWish, \"May you continue to be happy and free from suffering.\"\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd if you want, you can practice with your breath. When you breathe in, feel happy about their freedom or whatever they have which is free from obstacles, problems, and suffering. When you breathe out, feel happy about their happiness, skills, wisdom, and potential.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness for a while.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be just as it is. There is no need to follow any experiences or try to block them. Just let everything be, and rest in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice To begin, notice how having innate awareness, wisdom, and compassion is the greatest gift possible. Appreciate this truth.&nbsp;\nNow, expand your circle of care beyond yourself to include people whom you do not know very well. Think about your life, and bring to mind someone whom you encounter periodically, but have not had the chance to get to know. This could be a co-worker, or employee at the grocery store, or your mail carrier.&nbsp;\nAs you hold this person in mind, reflect on the fact that they share the same basic nature as you, and they too wish to be happy and free from suffering.\nImagine what it would be like to see this person in the eyes of their partner, child, or parent. Take a moment to shift your perspective and see this person through a lens of care, appreciation, and love. See if you can notice some of the positive attributes of this person that you normally would not.&nbsp;\nIf it helps, you can find a simple phrase to repeat in your mind that helps you stay connected to this sense of appreciation. It could be something like, \"May you never be separated from the joy that knows no suffering.\"\nNow, bring to mind people who may be far away from you—people in other places, cultures, religions, or races. As you bring them to mind, see if you can appreciate their basic goodness and inherent qualities. Get creative and use whatever strategies are helpful.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains how everyone has unique qualities, goodness, and wisdom. This is expressed in myriad ways. When you engage in this imaginative practice, thinking of a stranger's good qualities, does it impact your experience? If so, please explain.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.4 Joy for a Neutral Person Application\" data-href=\"2.3.4 Joy for a Neutral Person Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.4 Joy For A Neutral Person, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.4 joy for a neutral person, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for a Neutral Person: Meditation (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_a_Neutral_Person_Meditation_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for a Neutral Person: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_a_Neutral_Person_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475106,"modifiedTime":1759272586849,"sourceSize":5362,"sourcePath":"1.

It means having enough to eat, a place to live, and to go about one's life without threat of harm.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nhow to practice joy with people you do not know—so-called \"neutral\" people\nthe true meaning of all beings, even those you do not know\nthe transformative nature of appreciation and gratitude\nhow your mind-state influences your perspective of others\nWatch Read\nThis section is about the view of joy for a neutral person. Now, you need to expand your appreciation and joy, not only with people you like but also with strangers — people you do not know. Once you connect with feeling happy for their qualities and appreciate and have gratitude for their freedom, happiness, qualities, and skills, in the end, they all become like your best friend.\nLet me tell you a story. One time, I was at the airport, and we had to go through a tight security check. I went through all of it, and after we finished the security check I looked for my boarding area, which turned out to be near a security checkpoint. Then I was waiting at my seat for my flight, and there was one security guy who was looking at me. He was quite big and tall. He continued looking at me, and I thought, \"Why is he looking at me?\" I thought, \"Maybe he is not looking particularly at me, and it is just my imagination.\" But again he was looking at me and even talking to his colleagues and pointing his finger at me. And I thought, \"Wow! Why is he pointing at me? I did not do anything. I do not have any illegal things with me. I do not have any batteries\" — normally they explain a lot of restrictions to us — \"I do not have those things, so why is this guy pointing his finger at me?\" And when I looked at him, he looked like he was really mean and scary. And then he started to walk towards me. I thought \"Oh, gosh! Now, I am in big trouble.\" He looked like a gang member walking towards me. And he came close to me and asked, \"Are you Mr. Ranpoche?\" I said, \"What?\" He asked, \"Did you write a book called \"Joy of Living\"?\" I said \"Yes!\" He responded, \"Oh, thank you so much. Your book helped me a lot! I read it, and I was wondering if it was you or not. I was looking at you trying to figure it out. And I really wanted to express my appreciation, so I asked my colleague to cover my job and I came over. Your book is really good!\" He was really happy about my book and thankful. And then when I looked at him again, he had completely changed. He had become a very good guy, a good person, kind and good-hearted. I thought, \"Wow! What a nice person!\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] My perception, how I looked at him, had suddenly changed.\nThis practice is really powerful. Once you see these good things within everybody — even in a stranger you know nothing about — then they all become like your friends, your best friends, or your family. Therefore, others' happiness, others' qualities, and others' virtues become causes of happiness for you.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains how seeing others' good qualities can transform them into friends, even in the case of strangers. How do you understand this teaching?\nPoints to remember:\nThe essence of practicing with neutral people is to recognize their innate goodness.\nThe true nature of all beings, even those whom you do not know, is pure and pristine and filled with positive qualities.\nAppreciation and gratitude can entirely change the way you experience the world.\nWhen you change your mindstate, others become your friends.\nTip\nDo not let your initial perception confuse you—all beings possess basic goodness.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nhow afflictions can serve as opportunities\nabout the paradox of our human nature\nhow to form new habits\nabout the true source of happiness The Joy of Living, pp. 123-125 (Ch. 8: \"Affliction or Opportunity?\") <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.4 Joy for a Neutral Person Meditation\" data-href=\"2.3.4 Joy for a Neutral Person Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.4 Joy For A Neutral Person, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.4 joy for a neutral person, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for a Neutral Person: View (9 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_a_Neutral_Person_View_(9_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for a Neutral Person: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_a_Neutral_Person_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.4-joy-for-a-neutral-person-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475124,"modifiedTime":1759272586863,"sourceSize":4771,"sourcePath":"1.

This is a simple practice again.\nIn your daily life, you need to find five qualities about a difficult person. I think you can find them quite easily. There is no need to find something big. You may think a quality is not big, but it might be very big. A difficult person has awareness. It is always there, right? Just like for you. It looks simple. You might think it is not big, but it is actually very big. Write it down.\nMaybe the difficult person cares about their puppy, friends, or family. Great! This is the expression of love and compassion. Write it down. Maybe the difficult person washes dishes. Great! Maybe the difficult person has a special talent. Great!\nDo that. If it is not easy to find five things with one person, you can find them among a few people. That is okay. Difficult person A, difficult person B, difficult person C...\nIf you cannot find a difficult person, that is also good! Do not worry. Appreciate that you cannot find a difficult person. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Because when you think of a person as difficult, that is your own perspective. Actually, the difficult person is within you, right? So, if you cannot find one, that is also great!\nYou can write the qualities down, or if you cannot write you can just count them. Maybe you can count on your fingers or use an app. Do that.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesBegin by selecting a difficult person in your life. Remember, this person does not need to be terrible. They could simply be someone with whom you do not get along. Once you have this person in mind, spend some time considering their good qualities. At first glance, their good qualities may not be clear, but remember: Some of the most wonderful qualities are also often the most overlooked—like awareness! Once you reflect on this, find a medium that is comfortable for you to record your thoughts in. This could be the \"take notes\" option in this course, a phone app, or traditional pen and paper. Try to record five good qualities about this person.Journal Reflection QuestionsIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche says that \"your enemy is within you.\" This means that your view is based on a misunderstanding about others' true nature, which is pure and good. When you take this perspective—shifting the \"difficulty\" from outside to within—how does this change your experience? Do you relate to difficult people any differently? Please explain.Tip\nDon't overthink the four immeasurable practices. Simply recognize others' true nature.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person Summary\" data-href=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.5 Joy For A Difficult Person, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.5 joy for a difficult person, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.5 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for a Difficult Person: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_a_Difficult_Person_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475076,"modifiedTime":1759272586873,"sourceSize":3633,"sourcePath":"1.

Similarly, as with loving-kindness practice and compassion practice, practice for a difficult person is by definition difficult. This is the area of these practices that is the most challenging. But as with loving-kindness and compassion, it is really important that we learn how to separate the challenging behavior of this individual from who they truly are, understanding that all beings are endowed with an inherent true nature, with inherent basic goodness.\nThe challenge here is to explore the ways in which this individual's true nature expresses itself in spite of the fact that they often behave in a way that you find really challenging or really difficult.\nThere might be ways in which their kindness or compassion express themselves. They certainly have capabilities or abilities in some way. They might be very skilled professionals, or talented, in some way that allows them to do their job or care for their family, or whatever it is. The challenge here is to really examine all of the behavior of this person that we find difficult and identify those particular things that we would associate with the expression of their true nature, and then to rejoice in the fact that this individual has these abilities, that this individual behaves or do things in the way they do is also a natural expression of their true nature. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person View\" data-href=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.5 Joy For A Difficult Person, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.5 joy for a difficult person, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.5 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Joy for a Difficult Person (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Joy_for_a_Difficult_Person_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475070,"modifiedTime":1759272586881,"sourceSize":2074,"sourcePath":"1.

Actually, we are expanding the joy. You began with yourself, then someone you like, then a neutral person, and now a difficult person. And basically, we are all the same. A difficult person has a lot of great qualities.\nIn this case, maybe you can do a practice, if you like, imagining what it would be like if you were the best friend of this difficult person. You can do this kind of practice of exchanging places with someone who has a different perspective.\nLet's try this together. First, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, think of that difficult person and appreciate their qualities and skills. That difficult person has awareness, compassion, wisdom, and capabilities. Feel happy about those! They might have great skills which you do not have. They may have great kindness or compassion which you do not have.\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd you can use the phrase: \"May you continue to be happy and free from suffering.\" Or you can use the breath. When you breathe in, appreciate the freedom of that difficult person, and, when you breathe out, appreciate the happiness of that difficult person.\n[Silent meditation]\nWhatever quality you think of is okay. Maybe the difficult person washes the dishes. Wonderful! Maybe they clean the environment. Wonderful! Maybe the difficult person gives love to their family members and friends and cares about them. Wonderful!\nAnd if you want, you can imagine that you are the best friend of that difficult person.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nHow was it? Was it easy or difficult? Or instead of appreciating the qualities of that difficult person, you felt that your feeling of hatred became stronger? Sometimes that happens. When you begin to try to appreciate these things, then, suddenly, you see a lot of depreciating. You see a lot of faults and things that you really do not want to appreciate. These things may arise. That is okay and normal. I had that experience when I began to practice this meditation. Sometimes these are good signs. In whatever practice we do, at the beginning sometimes we feel like we are getting worse. Forget about improving — we feel that we are going backward. If you feel like you are going backward, that is a good sign! 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session As you begin, find a comfortable posture. Your spine is upright and your muscles are relaxed and at ease.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest the mind in open awareness, letting everything be just as it is. There is no need to do anything or fabricate any state. Just rest. This is a simple presence that is open and accommodating to whatever arises.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind a difficult person. Do not begin with the most difficult person, but rather someone who rubs you the wrong way. Bring to mind an image or felt sense of this person.&nbsp;\nAs you hold this person in your awareness, reflect on how you may struggle with this person, but nonetheless they too possess the qualities of love, compassion, and wisdom. Also recognize that they have people around them who love them and care for them; people who are able to see their qualities.&nbsp;\nIf you are unable to see their qualities directly, try stepping into the shoes of one of their loved ones. Rejoice in the fact that they experience moments of happiness and freedom from suffering.&nbsp;\nIf you struggle at times with this practice, don't worry. There is no reason to force anything. You can take a break at any time and rest in open awareness. Then, when you feel it is supportive to bring them to mind again, you can do so and continue the practice.&nbsp;\nPerhaps it is helpful to remember that they were once a young child, at a time when their qualities may not have been obscured. The key is simply cultivating a heart of appreciation for this person and their well-being.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the images, and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing and just be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche speaks about how these practices can often elicit a negative response—that we see others' negative qualities more than their positive ones. He says that this is entirely natural. How does this openness in regard to your experience change how you relate to difficult people? Do you feel you have expectations?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person Application\" data-href=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.5 Joy For A Difficult Person, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.5 joy for a difficult person, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.5 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for a Difficult Person: Meditation (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_a_Difficult_Person_Meditation_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for a Difficult Person: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_a_Difficult_Person_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475072,"modifiedTime":1759272586888,"sourceSize":6109,"sourcePath":"1.

Maybe that difficult person has a best friend, some family members, or some other person who loves them. It seems that sometimes, many people say \"This is the worst person in the world,\" but even a lot of dictators, when you think about them in history, also have good qualities within them.\nThere is no person born evil. It is really important for you to see these good things within that person, and the benefit is that you will feel happy. And that helps the relationship between you and that person to change, eventually. If you believe someone is a difficult person, a bad person, and no good, then, you are destroying the relationship between you and others. When we change the perspective, then it is almost like we are changing reality.\nIn my life, I have met many difficult people, but I always try to believe in the basic goodness within them. In the beginning, sometimes people say, \"Oh, be careful with this person. They are really... well, you know? You have to watch out.\" But if that person tries to connect with me, I try to connect, too. When you really have a conversation with that person, it is the same with them as with you. The other person is also a person, so you are the same. We all want to be happy and do not want to suffer.&nbsp;\nMaybe you cannot connect with that person the way your friend can, but from a different level, from a different aspect, there is a way in which you can connect. For me, this is really powerful.\nMaybe I will tell you a story. There was a problem between a stepmother and her stepdaughter. There is a custom of living all together in Asian culture, and very strong conflicts may come up. One time, a stepmother and her stepdaughter did not like each other. The stepmother thought that her stepdaughter was really bad and evil. And the stepdaughter thought that the stepmother was evil. They had a lot of arguments, and the conflict between the two became stronger and stronger.\nOne day, the stepdaughter thought, \"Oh, this is really, really bad. I hate my stepmother! I am going to kill her!\" And she went to the pharmacy and looked for a doctor. She said to the doctor, \"I have this evil stepmother, and I want to kill her, so I would like to buy some poison.\" And the doctor said, \"Oh, okay, this is quite dangerous. I will give you a gentle poison that you have to add to her food. And then, you will have to be very nice to her. Otherwise, if you give her a stronger poison and she dies right away, everybody will think that maybe you poisoned her, and eventually they will find me. So, we will do it in a very smart way. Add this poison, and she will die very slowly. But then, you need to seemingly develop your relationship with her. You have to say, 'Hello, good morning. How are you?' and treat her well. Then nobody will have doubts.\" And the stepdaughter thought, \"Wow, good idea!\"\nThen she went back to her home and added the poison to her stepmother's food. She also changed her way of communicating with her: \"Hello! Good morning, Grandma\" — or whatever — \"Would you like to have a cup of tea?\" [Mingyur Rinpoche feigns a smile.] And when she prepared the food and added the poison, she said nicely, \"This food is for you!\"\nAnd at the beginning, the stepmother did not like her. She did not talk so much. But slowly, she began to think, \"Oh, my stepdaughter is quite good. I thought that she was very evil, but now I am beginning to like her.\" And she began to respond well to her.\nEventually, the stepdaughter thought, \"Oh, my stepmother is not so bad.\" And she also began to like her and stopped poisoning her. Then, slowly, the two became very good friends.\nThen, the stepdaughter thought, \"Oh, I made a mistake! I put a lot of poison in her food.\" She went to the doctor and said, \"Please, give me the antidote,\" and the doctor asked, \"Why?\" She responded, \"Now, I like my stepmother. Actually, she is a good person. I made a mistake. I want to have the antidote to heal whatever damage the poison caused.\" But the doctor said, \"There is no antidote.\" Hearing this, she was very sad and began to cry. The doctor asked, \"Why are you crying?\" She said, \"You said that there is no antidote,\" to which the doctor responded, \"Yes, there is no antidote because that was not poison!\" What the doctor had given her were just sugar pills. Being very smart, the doctor had asked her to slowly change how she treated her stepmother, and eventually, they became very good friends. Then the stepdaughter was very happy, and both stepmother and stepdaughter lived happily ever after. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs]\nAnyway, it is really powerful to practice joy with a difficult person in your life, if you have difficult colleagues, a difficult boss, or difficult family members. Of course, when you practice this, in the beginning, it will be quite difficult. But if you try again and again, slowly it will transform the relationship between you and that difficult person.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche recaps a story of a disgruntled step-mother and step-daughter. In this story, the step-daughter conspires to poison her step-mother. However, the doctor who gave the step-daughter the poison luckily saw beyond their short-term conflict and gave her a sugar pill instead of actual poison. Overtime, they reconciled their differences resulting in a lasting friendship. . What is the moral of this story? Moreover, how does it illustrate the power of practicing with difficult people?\nPoints to remember:\nThe fourth step in meditating on joy is practicing with difficult people.\nIf you see others' goodness, often this will change your relationship for the better.\nSeeing others' goodness gives rise to happiness in your own experience.\nTrusting others often leads to their trusting you more.\nRelationships change over time, often for the better.\nInquiry\nIn which relationships could you create space for new understanding to unfold?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nabout the true nature of all beings\nabout the impact of not recognizing someone's true nature\nhow ignorance impacts our ability to perceive others for what they truly are\nhow the path of meditation unfolds step by step Joyful Wisdom, pp. 208-210 (Ch. 10: \"Hidden Gold\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person Meditation\" data-href=\"2.3.5 Joy for a Difficult Person Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.5 Joy For A Difficult Person, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.5 joy for a difficult person, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.5 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for a Difficult Person: View (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_a_Difficult_Person_View_(8_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for a Difficult Person: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_a_Difficult_Person_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.5-joy-for-a-difficult-person-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475053,"modifiedTime":1759272586901,"sourceSize":7561,"sourcePath":"1.

Some people load up back­packs and go hiking in the mountains for fun. Some people carry heavy loads all day for work, and the idea of walking around with a heavy bag for fun might seem crazy. The point is to recognize how much our everyday activities are driven by moving toward our preconceptions of physical and emotional comfort and by moving away from discomfort, aversion, and dissatisfaction.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, we will practice immeasurable joy, with all beings. Every day, whenever you see something beautiful, eat delicious food, or if you have some particular belonging you like, try to share it. Of course, if you are really too attached to it, maybe you cannot really share it. But pick out something precious that you normally do not share, or notice if you hear a nice bird singing or see something nice, and first appreciate it. It does not matter if it is a person, an animal, or the environment — it could be anything.\nYou can buy some beautiful flowers, take photos of beautiful mountains, or prepare food or whatever and share it with one person. One day, one person. First, you appreciate whatever object it is and then share it with someone. It does not matter whether the person is your family member, your kid or parent, someone you do not like, or a neutral person. It could be anyone.\nTry this. This is your homework.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesEach day, select at least one pleasant experience. It could be smelling a fragrant flower, gazing at a beautiful vista, eating some delicious food, or whatever brings you joy. First, appreciate the happiness you experience in this situation. Then, find a way to share it with someone else. For example, if you are able to pick or buy the flower, do so and offer it to someone else. Or try to take a picture of the vista and send it to someone else. You do not need to feel stressed-out about this activity. It could be something very small each time. The key is to simply notice what happens in your heart when you engage in the practice in this way.Journal Reflection QuestionsMingyur Rinpoche encourages you to offer your pleasant experiences to others. As you engage in this practice, how does your experience of these situations change? Do you find you cling to the experiences more or less? Is there perhaps more letting go? Please explain.&nbsp;Are there things in your life that are too important for you to be willing to share with others? If so, does this practice influence your relationship with these things/experiences?&nbsp;In this section, you extend your wish of well-being for others to beings you will never encounter.

You see, Mingyur Rinpoche shares his discovery from when he awoke from his near-death experience in the hospital room. This was during his wandering retreat a few years ago.\nAnd so, Mingyur Rinpoche is gently moving us towards his discovery through these practices of rejoicing — rejoicing in others, everything around us, to really rejoicing in the whole world. And \"rejoice\" really means \"to take great joy in\" or \"to delight in.\" He is asking us to expand our circle of delight. Who else and what else can we include?\nOne of my teachers on this subject has been my mother. She recently moved from a large apartment into a much smaller one, in more challenging circumstances. In her life, she trained her mind to look for the good in things. And so, she saw this beautiful tree outside her window, and that is what her attention gravitated towards. She found such joy and such comfort in this tree.

Just as I wish to avoid suffering, all beings wish to avoid suffering.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, we will practice joy for all beings, the same as with love and compassion. Now, you appreciate, feel happy about, and have gratitude for the qualities, skills, and fundamental nature of all beings.&nbsp;\nI have said that bees contribute to the entire world, the same as different animals, different people, a variety of cultures, a variety of mentalities, and a variety of spiritual lineages. We all are, in a way, interdependent and supporting each other. For example, if we are driving a car and get stuck in a traffic jam, normally we complain: \"Oh, nobody is really doing a good job,\" but actually everybody is trying their best to find a way out of this traffic jam. But normally, we do not see that. We only see the negative aspects.\nNow, we are going to practice immeasurable joy for all beings. Please keep your meditation posture, and rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, think of the qualities of all beings. No matter who they are, or where they are, they all have great innate qualities, potential, skills. Appreciate that. Feel happy about that.\n[Silent meditation]\nWish that all beings continue to be happy and free from suffering.\n[Silent meditation]\nYou can, if it works for you, do this with your breathing. When you breathe in, appreciate whatever freedoms all beings have. When you breathe out, appreciate the happiness of all beings.\nBasically, our true nature is always wonderful.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session As you begin, find a comfortable posture. Your spine is upright and your muscles are relaxed and at ease.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest the mind in open awareness, letting everything be just as it is. There is no need to do anything or fabricate any state. Just rest. This is a simple presence that is open and accommodating to whatever arises.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind someone who naturally gives rise to a sense of connection, appreciation, and love. Imagine that this person is here in your presence. Remember that they have basic goodness, imbued with awareness, compassion, and wisdom.&nbsp;\nNext, imagine how they might see you—valuing your true nature and good qualities. Imagine what it would feel like to be valued and seen by this person for all your inherent goodness.&nbsp;\nNow, slowly begin to expand beyond this person, bringing to mind people who are close to you, who you may have difficulty with, and who you do not know very well. Recognize that each of these people possesses basic goodness, and numerous positive qualities.&nbsp;\nIf it is helpful, you can use simple phrases, such as \"May your good qualities continue to grow and flourish.\" Experiment and see what helps you remain connected with a sense of appreciation and gratitude.\nNow, drop the meditation and rest in open awareness. There is no need to think of or feel anything particular. Completely let go, and simply be.&nbsp;\nWhen you are ready, return to the meditation. This time, cultivate a sense of universal appreciation and gratitude toward all beings in all directions. If it is helpful, you can use a simple phrase and repeat it in your head.&nbsp;\nAs you are engaging in this practice, see whether you can keep in mind that every being that exists has fundamental value and worth; that all beings have pure and pristine basic goodness.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the phrase and images, and simply rest in open awareness. Let go of any doing and just be.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains that all beings are interconnected and that the world itself is interdependent. He again provides the example of bees' role in our ecosystem. Do you have strategies for connecting with this interconnectedness in your formal practice? If so, what are they? Please explain.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.6 Joy for All Beings Application\" data-href=\"2.3.6 Joy for All Beings Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.6-joy-for-all-beings-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.6 Joy For All Beings, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.6 joy for all beings, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.6 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for All Beings: Meditation (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_All_Beings_Meditation_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for All Beings: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_All_Beings_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.6-joy-for-all-beings-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.6-joy-for-all-beings-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475039,"modifiedTime":1759272586929,"sourceSize":5615,"sourcePath":"1.

The numbers are boundless therefore the motivation must be boundless.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe reality of interconnectedness\nthe role of recognition in the practice of joy\nhow appreciation promotes wisdom\nhis near-death experience while on his wandering retreat\nWatch Read\nNow, we are going to expand joy for all beings and even with the environment. Appreciate that you are part of this world, and appreciate that you have all these beings in the world. Everything is interconnected, right? Some scientists say that the bee is really an important part of our ecosystem. If there were no bees, then the balance of the ecosystem might be lost. So, we are all really interconnected. Imagine if you came into this world, and, after being born, you were left alone. You would not be able to survive. You need help from others — from beings, and from the environment.\nAs in the example of the watch, which I gave in level one: If you have a watch, even the best watch in the world, but you do not know your watch, the watch cannot tell you the time. By recognizing, appreciating, rejoicing, and feeling happy about these great things about the world and all others, it becomes like finding a treasure. It might be like finding a treasure island with gold or diamonds.\nLet me tell you a story. A few years back, I went on a wandering retreat. I left my monastery with only a few thousand rupees. I had no particular plan for where to stay. I had no particular plan for how to get food. I ended up in a place called, \"Kushinagar\" in India. And when the few thousand rupees were gone, I had to live on the streets.\nI had never begged for food in my entire life, and I began to beg for food: \"Can you please give me your leftover food?\" The restaurant owner was very happy to give me food leftovers, but the food was not clean, so I got diarrhea. I was vomiting and had diarrhea, and I had no money for medicine. I was sick for many days, and all I could get was water. There was a well in which I could pump water. [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to pump water] If you do like this the water comes up, and you can drink it. But on day five, in the afternoon, my body had really become dysfunctional. I could not really sit straight, my head became very heavy, I was shaking, and I had no energy. I thought, \"Oh, maybe I am going to die.\" I had fear. So then, I just followed the flow of the situation.\nThen at night, around 1 or 2 a.m., my body really became paralyzed. I could not see, my senses dissolved, and I felt sensations of falling, floating, and burning — a lot of different experiences. Eventually, all the senses were totally gone and my body became paralyzed, but awareness became clearer and clearer.\nIn the end, I almost became unconscious, and then, suddenly, everything became so open! There was an experience of pure awareness — I could experience it, but there was no concept. Right now, if we think about something, there are images, voices, physical sensations — all these were gone. The awareness was without direction — no front, behind, up, or down. Also, there was no time. I knew very well what was going on, but at the same time, it was not the normal way of comprehending the situation around me. You can experience the awareness but you cannot really describe it.\nI was resting in that state for a few hours until around 7 or 8 a.m. in the morning. Then, somehow, I came back. I felt the sense that this was not the end. The feeling that this was not the end became stronger and stronger. It was like a feeling of joy, compassion, and love, and that feeling became stronger and stronger. Then, suddenly, I felt my body, I slowly moved my fingers, I could hear things, and then I could open my eyes.\nWhen I fully recovered, the entire street had changed for me. Before, I felt, \"Why did I come here? The street is very dirty and unsafe. How can I survive like this for months or years? I should go back.\" But now, the street became like my home. And I felt it was so fresh! When I looked at a tree, it was the same tree, but for me, it looked different. The leaves were really shining. When the wind touched my face, I felt so happy and joyful. You could say that the trees were made of love.\nThen I stood up, and I felt a little bit thirsty. I looked around for the water pump, took a few steps, and then became unconscious, so someone took me to a hospital. I woke up in the hospital, stayed there for one night, and recovered.\nAnd after that, the feeling of not being safe, the feeling of fear and insecurity, was kind of gone. I normally say, \"If you love the world, the world loves you back.\" After that, I knew where to go, I could find food, and I became quite smart. In the winter, I stayed in a warm place; in the summer, I went to the Himalayas. And wherever I went, many people supported me. Even when I thought, \"Oh, there is no food today,\" something would happen that would provide me with food for the next few days.\nI think it is really important to connect with the basic, innate goodness of all beings, and not only of beings but also of the environment. For us, this is what is meant by \"pure perception.\" Once you see these qualities within all beings, as well as in the environment, then you can find joy everywhere.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche gives the example of bees and their place in the world's ecosystem. He explains that if you were to remove them, everything would collapse. He suggests that this is similar to human interconnection: if you view others with contempt, anger, and hatred, then relationships break down. How might you describe the significance of this example to a friend?\nPoints to remember:\nEveryone and everything in the world is interconnected.\nRecognizing the true nature of others is the key to practicing joy.\nAppreciation promotes wisdom.\nTip\nOnce you see basic goodness in the world, everything is a source of joy.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nuseful tips for choosing what practice to use when\nhow easily the mind gets distracted\nhow to keep your practice fresh\nabout \"short times, many times\" The Joy of Living, pp. 194-195 ( Ch. 14: \"Choose What Works for You\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.3.6 Joy for All Beings Meditation\" data-href=\"2.3.6 Joy for All Beings Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.6-joy-for-all-beings-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.3.6 Joy For All Beings, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.3.6 joy for all beings, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.3.6 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Joy for All Beings: View (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Joy_for_All_Beings_View_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Joy for All Beings: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Joy_for_All_Beings_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.6-joy-for-all-beings-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.3/2.3.6-joy-for-all-beings-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475022,"modifiedTime":1759272586941,"sourceSize":7080,"sourcePath":"1.

I also hope that you have found that it built upon your practice of recognizing awareness from level one and that you now see and have some experience of how recognizing awareness can expand to also include others — those who are close to us, like our loved ones, like our families, but also everyone, including difficult people and, of course, the biggest bunch of people, so to speak, all the neutral people in the world. Most people are neutral to us. We can also include these motivations and practices to include those people as well.\nAs I said, I hope this has been a good experience for you. It certainly has been a great experience for me to do this together with all of you. I hope to see you in the next and final level, level three of Joy of Living, where we will explore the wisdom aspect and look at this more so we can continue to build on the practice we have done in levels one and two.\nAgain, all the best in your practice, and I hope to see you in the future. Conclusion to the Course by Antonia Sumbundu Read\nHi again! First of all, I would like to congratulate you! You have not only completed this course on transforming emotions and equanimity, but you have also completed all the Joy of Living level two courses now. This has been quite a journey. And I have really enjoyed the opportunity to revisit these practices and to engage in them with you.\nThese practices are really practices that we can continue to use for the rest of our lives. They are practices that help us, again, to recognize our own basic goodness and our innate qualities and practices that really help us to strengthen the recognition and the expression of these qualities in our lives. So, they are practices that really make a difference to us, as we live our lives, but also practices that really make a difference to the people we are in contact with. They are practices that we can do not just for our own benefit, but also just knowing how much benefit they are for others.\nI hope that these practices will continue to enrich your own life, to unfold in your own life, and to benefit everybody you come in contact with. Watch Read\nCongratulations! Now, you have finished level two. I am very happy that you have been practicing up until now. The essence of level two is two things. The first is to connect with your fundamental nature. Here, we discussed love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. And the second important thing is transformation — transforming everything into love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. This is what we call \"self-liberation\" or \"self-antidote.\" I think that by now, you have already got the meaning of this, right? That is very good. Wonderful! Those of you who already finished the homework, wonderful! If you have not finished it, please do not forget it. Continue, so that you finish the homework. When you engage in daily life, there are two important things. One is formal meditation practice. Every day, keep at least twenty minutes for daily meditation practice. That time is fully dedicated to meditation. But, of course, sometimes when you feel back pain from sitting straight, you can use support for your back, or you can stand up. You can walk while you are doing this formal practice as long as you are not communicating with others or watching television and the time is fully dedicated to your practice. If you have a lot of back pain, you can even lie down. Face up and keep your spine straight. Or you can lie down on your right side, in what we call the \"sleeping Buddha posture.\" Keep your spine straight, and adjust your pillow. All this can be done for formal meditation. With informal meditation, you can practice anywhere, anytime, and under any circumstances, the same as in level one. It is the same thing. Short times, many times. There are a lot of tools, right? Now, you have a nice tool kit. You already have a lot from level one, as awareness has a lot of options, right? Although it looks like there are a lot of options, there is actually just one: awareness. Now, here, you also have a lot of options. Sometimes, if you feel bored with the practice of love, you can change it to compassion practice. Sometimes with compassion you feel tired and fed up: \"Oh joy, how nice! Appreciation!\" And after practicing appreciation every day, \"Equanimity!\" So, try these different practices because just doing one practice feels boring. Use different practices, and then transform your difficult emotions into love and compassion, joy, and equanimity. Or transform suffering. Face the challenging situations in your life. And through that, you can help others. You can help your friends, family, and the environment. That is also really important. If you help the environment, you help many other people also. Even if you cannot do a lot, you can meditate, and when you finish your meditation, if you see garbage, you can clean it up. Save whatever you can, like water or light. Or produce less pollution for your part, right? Also, encourage others to help with that. I hope that, by this practice, you see the meaning of life, see our fundamental nature, and transform everything into love, compassion, joy, and equanimity. Thank you! And maybe I will see you in the third level. The third level is more focused on wisdom. Until now, in level one we discussed awareness very deeply and clearly. In level two, we discussed love and compassion and all this very clearly. And in level three, we will discuss wisdom.

It's naturally peaceful, like the mind of a young child accompanying his parents through a museum.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nThis section is about the application for transforming difficult emotions into love and compassion. The key point is that, in daily life, the most problematic things are aversion and craving — these two.\nWhen I was young, I had panic. For me, the most problematic part was the panic of panic, fear of panic, or aversion of panic. Maybe, if you are stressed, one of the biggest problems may be the stress of stress, fear of stress, aversion, not liking it, or particularly looking for peace or relaxation. \"I am not getting this. I need peace!\" That craving and aversion to stress make the stress bigger. \"Oh, I am stressed. I do not like this stress. Stress drives me crazy.\" That is the same thing — aversion.\n\"Self-liberation\" or \"self-antidote\" means you are not controlling or trying to get rid of the stress. You are transforming stress into love and compassion. Remember that in everyday life. Especially in everyday life, the first step is to be aware of the triggers of this stress, hatred, or panic in some situations. Try to look at those. In particular, if you can, maybe you can make a special plan for this transformation, because to transform these difficult emotions into love and compassion takes time. It cannot happen overnight, of course.\nMaybe you can even use an app to make it an everyday habit. With the app, you can send a message to yourself as a reminder and use other features. The important thing is that when you are facing difficult emotions, in particular with the triggers, the triggers are the reminders of your practice. After being triggered, you will have real emotions, right? But especially if you are having a very strong emotion within you, do not jump into that emotion first because sometimes you cannot transform it.\nWhen I was young, I could not transform my panic right away, so I created anger, as anger was not my major problem. Then, I transformed anger into love and compassion — I transformed it into awareness and then into love and compassion — and when I transformed that, I felt quite happy. I gained more experience with that, and then I came back to my panic.\nDo that. You can write down how much you do every day and which days and times you get more stressed or this emotion comes. When you meet somebody, maybe you can think, \"Whenever I meet that person, I will have this.\" That person triggers your emotion, right?&nbsp;Remember that.\nThe first step is to bring awareness, \"Oh, I am having this emotion.\" Then, the second step is to transform. You can do three steps if you have time. First, remember you are having this emotion. Second, understand the suffering within that person when they have emotions. Third, take that person's emotion into your emotion.\nTry this, okay? Do this homework in your life, and, again, remember that when you first do that you might feel like, \"Oh, I am not ready for this. It is difficult to do.\" That is normal.\nIf it is more difficult to take others' problems into yourself, then you can look at the essence of your emotion. There is still love and compassion. Give that love and compassion to others, or send it to others. It is more like the sending practice. Or when you take others' emotions into yourself, that is virtue and love. The taking is love and compassion. Send that love and compassion to others, as well. Do that.\nTry different things. The main thing is that you need to develop this habit, especially when you are facing these difficult emotions. Difficult emotions are normally really good. Eventually, they will really become your friends and teachers.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAs you go about your daily activities, pay attention to your emotional triggers. These could be particular times of day, situations, and/or people you encounter that elicit an emotional response. The important thing is that you pick a specific situation that you are going to work with. Pay attention to how and when your afflictive emotions arise. If possible, record your experience using a modality that you are comfortable with. This could be an app or a journal. As you become aware of these triggers, see if you can anticipate them and use them for transformation—seeing them as emblematic of your wish to be happy and free from suffering.Journal Reflection Questions\nMingyur Rinpoche refers to an emotional reality below the surface. This could be, for example, panic of panic or feeling angry about being angry. He explains that these are often the source of our suffering. Are you able to see these arise in your experience? If so, how do you work with them?\nWe each have unique emotional experiences. What patterns do you experience that you wish to transform? How do you imagine this could happen most effectively?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions Summary\" data-href=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.1 transforming difficult emotions, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.1 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transforming Difficult Emotions: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transforming_Difficult_Emotions_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475502,"modifiedTime":1759272586975,"sourceSize":5975,"sourcePath":"1.

Welcome back. This week, we are going to talk about something that I have found extremely helpful and that has really transformed my view about what I am capable of and what everybody is capable of. We are going to look at a practice that is a true door to freedom and transformation. We are going to talk about how to transform difficult emotions.\nPerhaps just take a moment and look at your life day to day. Just look at times when you experience that you are most in pain, experiencing emotional pain. You may see that, at these times, sometimes the emotion is not just something that is there for a split second or a few minutes, but something that can really be longer-lasting. I think we all recognize these times when we feel hijacked by emotions, or when we feel caught in emotions, and how painful it can be. And one of the really beautiful things that we will be seeing here is that we do not need strategies and methods to make these emotions go away. We do not need to add another emotion on top of them so that we cannot feel them. What we can do is see how this emotion is a door to love and compassion.\nOne time in my own life when I really experienced the power of this was a time when I had lost a loved one. I remember that experience of grief and sadness, and they were emotions that I could not push away because they were just so strong. By really recognizing what it was that caused the pain and how it felt in my body and in my mind, and how it affected my life, I could then look at others and remember that when they are grieving or really sad, they are experiencing the same, and it has the same effect on their minds, bodies, and lives. I could see how natural compassion and love would actually arise, and it was not so far away to wish that others would not need to go through this pain and that my emotion and pain that were already there could be the representatives for that of others so they did not have to experience that negative effect.\nAnd I could see that the whole emotion was changed from something that was very narrowing and painful to something actually held in a much more open space and imbued by love and compassion. In that way, the emotion was transformed. I just remember seeing the power of it and seeing how it really helped me to come out of the loneliness that also comes with strong emotions to see the connection to others and see how we are really all in the same boat when we are caught in negative emotions.\nWhen we work with emotions, it is good to remember that it is really a gradual process. We can just take our time and do it in a way that is manageable and that is in itself an expression of love and compassion.\nI look forward to hearing more about how you experience this practice and the teachings and to connect with you again. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions View\" data-href=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.1 transforming difficult emotions, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.1 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Transforming Difficult Emotions (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Transforming_Difficult_Emotions_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475494,"modifiedTime":1759272586983,"sourceSize":3530,"sourcePath":"1.

In this session, we will mainly focus on difficult emotions. Difficult emotions can be hatred, jealousy, craving or desire, pride, confusion, or panic. When I was young, I practiced this with my panic. Stress, depression, low self-esteem, phobias, or a feeling of loneliness — you can transform anything, including all of these emotions, into loving-kindness and compassion. Now, maybe we will choose one emotion. Normally, I like to choose hatred, but sometimes hatred may not be our major emotion. Nowadays, many people feel stressed. Maybe we can use stress this time. Do you feel stressed? If you ever feel stressed, raise your hand. Okay, I think you raised your hand. The first step of this practice is that we need to bring out those emotions: stress, hatred, low self-esteem, or whatever we may have. If you feel these emotions very strongly within you, then you do not need to bring them out because they are already there. But if you do not feel any strong emotions, first remember a past situation when you did. Then, the second step is to understand that if you have this emotion, you are not happy, right? Try to understand this with yourself, and at the same time, try to understand it with others. Whoever has this emotion is unhappy and wants to be free from it. The third step is to now transform your emotion into love and compassion. Those are the three steps. We are going to practice this together. First, please keep your meditation posture and rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, first, remember whatever source of difficult emotions you may have, or, if you already feel this difficult emotion now, just be aware of it. The first step is to be aware of the difficult emotion. [Silent meditation] When you have this emotion, you are not happy. When you feel hatred, you are actually in pain and feel hurt. There is fear, a feeling of insecurity, and a feeling of loneliness, also. There are a lot of other emotions that come along with your hatred. Try to see and recognize them. You want to be free from this hatred. It is the same with stress. With stress, it is easier to recognize, right? You do not like to be stressed. When you are stressed, you are not in peace. You are tired and bored, you have a loss of energy, and there is fear. You want to be free from these problems.\n[Silent meditation] Now, think of others out there. Other people, when they feel stress or hatred, are just like you. They are also unhappy and want to be free from this stress. And at a fundamental level, they all have innate goodness. Their nature is free of stress, suffering, and hatred, but they do not know. They cling to and are too attached to this stress or hatred and the causes or object of stress or hatred. And they continue to suffer. [Silent meditation] Now, the third step is to take others' stress or hatred into your own stress or hatred. We will do this practice by imagining, the taking and sending practice, with our breath. Or you can use phrases: \"May my stress be the representation of all beings' stress, and may they be freed from stress because of my own stress.\" Or just feel it. You can use whatever you use normally. Maybe we will use the breathing exercise. Now, take a deep breath in, and take all others' stress into your own stress. Now, as you breathe out, wish that they all be free from stress. You are taking others' stress into your own stress. And breathe out. \"May they all be free from stress.\" [Silent meditation] You are taking others' hatred, jealousy, panic, or depression into your own panic, depression, jealousy, or whatever. \"May my panic and jealousy be the representations of all beings' jealousy and panic.\" [Silent meditation] \"May they be free from hatred, panic, and all these difficult emotions because of my own emotions.\" [Silent meditation] \"How nice! Today, my stress, hatred, and panic become meaningful! How nice!\" [Silent meditation] Through this practice, you have already accumulated a lot of love, compassion, and virtue. Now, send this to others. [Silent meditation] Okay. How was it? Sometimes, we may feel like, \"Wow, now my stress has become bigger because I am taking others' stress.\" Or \"I will be more unhappy if I get all beings' suffering or pain.\" But actually, it is the opposite. You know that the unhealthy sense of self is always only thinking about \"me.\" \"I have to win, and the others have to lose.\" That makes you more unhappy and more connected with negative emotions. But if you connect with the healthy sense of self, the self which is connected with love, compassion, awareness, and wisdom — we already discussed this — you will become happier. With this practice, actually, on a deeper level, we become happier. And not only that. It will transform your hatred into love and compassion. Normally, that is very difficult, and we feel there is no way to transform hatred into love and compassion. You might say, \"No hatred, no hatred,\" but if you say that, the hatred will become stronger. Or you may say, \"Compassion, compassion!\" That does not work sometimes. In order to fight with your enemy, you are using another army. You need to fight. But now, with this practice, the enemy becomes your friend. Hatred itself becomes love and compassion. Then, you do not have to fight. This is self-liberation or self-transformation. You do not need to block hatred. You do not need to fight it. You just say, \"Hello, hatred!\" Then you do these three steps, and it transforms into love and compassion. The feeling that — by taking all others' stress into your stress — it will become bigger is normal, in general. When we do this practice, we might feel that. Actually, that is a very good sign. When you feel more insecure in a way or scared of taking others' emotions, it is because the unhealthy sense of self is a little bit nervous. Do not worry — we have a healthy sense of self, and, eventually, this practice really helps to open our mind and heart. We become braver in a way. Fear comes because of these negative emotions. When we are free of these negative emotions, then, actually, there is no fear. Fear and expectations, these two, or aversion and craving, these are the same things, are the ones that are making the suffering and they become the causes of negative emotions and suffering. Once you are free from them, genuine happiness will be right there. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to acknowledge what is present in your awareness. What thoughts, emotions, feelings, and sensations are you experiencing?\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be just as it is. There is no need to follow any experiences or to try to block them. Just let everything be, while resting in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind a situation that is challenging in your life. Do not start with the most difficult, but rather something that is relatively workable. Notice any thoughts or emotions that are present. In particular, take note of any challenging emotions or thoughts. Where do you feel these in your body? What images are connected to them?\nWhen you experience troublesome thoughts or feelings, see if you can notice the natural desire to avoid this discomfort, or the desire to be free from hardship and suffering. This is the first step: noticing what is present.&nbsp;\nNext, expand your awareness to include other people, understanding that they, too, experience pain, suffering, and hardships. And, just like you, they do not want to feel this way. Notice this common ground.&nbsp;\nNow, imagine that your suffering is representative of that of others; imagine that by experiencing challenges in your life, others are freed from similar hardships. If it is helpful, you can use a phrase like this: \"May my challenges and adversities take the place of others' difficulties and free them from pain and suffering.\"&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, let go of the reflection, and let the mind be, as it is, in the present moment. When you feel it is supportive to do so, return to the practice and continue.&nbsp;\nAs you do this, see if your attitude about your challenging thoughts and emotions shifts when you imagine them as a gateway for others to be free from hardship. In this way, your negative emotions can become a vehicle for transformation.&nbsp; End session Now, let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche describes three steps for transforming afflictive emotions into love and compassion: 1) becoming aware of your own afflictive emotions; 2) recognizing that others share in the experience of these emotions; and 3) imagining taking others' afflictive emotions into your own. When you engage in these steps, how does it affect your experience of your own afflictive emotions?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Tip\nFeeling fear is a good sign—it means that your unhealthy sense of self is being challenged.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions Application\" data-href=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.1 transforming difficult emotions, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Transforming Difficult Emotions: Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Transforming_Difficult_Emotions_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transforming Difficult Emotions: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transforming_Difficult_Emotions_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475488,"modifiedTime":1759272586997,"sourceSize":11036,"sourcePath":"1.

This is a really important practice of the second level. Traditionally, we call it \"self-liberation\" or \"self-antidote.\"\nLove and compassion are also part of our innate qualities, just like awareness. Awareness is with us all the time, 24/7. Now, maybe you are fed up hearing that love and compassion are with you 24/7, right? Actually, they are with us all the time, but the problem is that we do not recognize this love and compassion, which are with us 24/7. Love and compassion are always there, even when you are experiencing negative or difficult emotions and when you are having problems in your life, like situational or environmental problems. Even when you are experiencing stress, the essence of that stress, at a basic level, is love and compassion. The problem is that we do not recognize our innate love and compassion. We are clinging too much to the conceptual or surface level.\nNow, we need to really focus on transforming difficult emotions and obstacles that we face in everyday life. This practice is what we also call \"self-transformation,\" or \"self-antidote.\" For example, you already know my story about the water going into my ear. My teacher said, \"Use more water.\" I put more water into my ear and did this [Mingyur Rinpoche tilts his head to the side,] and then the small amount of water in my ear came out. I used water to clean out the water that was already in my ear.\nAnother traditional example is what we call \"transforming poison into medicine.\" If you transform poison into medicine, then it is no longer poisonous for you. Another example is transforming your enemy into your friend or bodyguard. If your enemy becomes your bodyguard, then they are the best bodyguard, right?\nThis notion of \"self-antidote\" or \"self-liberation\" comes from connecting with the fundamental quality, the basic goodness, that is with us all the time and to see that.\nNow, to connect with this basic goodness, our innate love and compassion, there are two levels of practice. For the first level, we begin with concepts. In order to go beyond concepts, we first need to connect with the concepts. However, basic innate love and compassion are more or less non-judgmental. There is no subject or object, and it is not a conceptual experience. Therefore, it is quite difficult. It is not so easy to connect with that. So, first we will use the concept of love and compassion to connect with innate love and compassion. And later, we just connect with the feeling or motivation that is with us all the time. Those are the two steps.\nThe first step we are going to use is one you have already learned — taking and sending practice or a phrase that we use when we practice love and compassion. Or you can just feel or sense it, like in the practice that you already used with love and compassion, particularly for difficult emotions, problems, and obstacles in your life.\nWe will do this in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the beginning of the problem—so to speak—is the failure to recognize your basic goodness and fundamental wish to be happy and free from suffering. He says that this inability leads to immense suffering. How does not recognizing your innate nature lead to suffering?\nPoints to remember:\nYour fundamental nature is pure, pristine, and filled with positive qualities.&nbsp;\nYou can transform problems into love through recognizing the underlying wish to be happy.&nbsp;\nAfflictive emotions become a \"self-antidote\" when you see them as expressions of your love.\nInquiry\nCan you experience fundamental love right now in this moment?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nabout the three traditional stages of learning\nhow to use reflective questions to better understand your mental and emotional state\nabout the role of nonjudgmental observation within all forms of meditation practices\nabout transitioning from an intellectual to experiential level of understanding Joyful Wisdom, pp. 125-127 (Ch. 6: \"Three Stages of Practice\") <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions Meditation\" data-href=\"2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.1 Transforming Difficult Emotions, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.1 transforming difficult emotions, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.1 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Transforming Difficult Emotions: View (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Transforming_Difficult_Emotions_View_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transforming Difficult Emotions: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transforming_Difficult_Emotions_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.1-transforming-difficult-emotions-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475475,"modifiedTime":1759272587007,"sourceSize":5226,"sourcePath":"1.

Now, we need to have a small project. It is important, at first, to start with an easy one. Normally, you want to transform a habit, but you cannot. You can begin to try, but, of course, you cannot transform everything. But you can transform a small part of the habit. If you are eating too much, then maybe first just work on the problem of eating ice cream, not all food. If ice cream is the major one, then maybe choose the second habit that you want to transform. It could be when you want to eat it, when you are already eating it, or when you already ate it and feel regret and guilt. Use this difficult situation by transforming it into love and compassion. It could also be a relationship problem. Maybe you are arguing all the time. And if arguments between you and your family, partner, children, or even colleagues are the main problem, maybe you cannot transform the main triggers or the main source of the argument, but you can choose one small thing. \"Okay, from tomorrow on, when I argue about this small thing, I will remember to transform it into love and compassion.\" Or it could be a physical disease, a problem at your job, or a problem that you are facing from the environment. It does not mean that you are not looking for a solution. If you are sick, of course, you should get checked by a doctor and follow the doctor's advice. Of course, you should do these things. But at the same time, the pain does not go away, and the problem does not go away. If you transform inside, that is even good for healing disease. And it is good for the improvement of whatever habits, situations, or obstacles you have and for transforming them into love and compassion. At the same time, you will find the solution to solve this problem in a better way, also. In a way, your obstacles and problems become precious in this case. Your problems will help you to develop love and compassion, wisdom, and awareness. And your problems will help you to be free from suffering and continuous negative actions. Actually, this is real inner recycling.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a few minutes to bring to mind a situation, relationship, or habitual pattern that you would like to transform. Remember, start with something small and more manageable—it could be part of a larger habit that you have. For example, if overeating is something you struggle with, do not try to transform the entire habit right away. Instead, choose a component of the habit. This could be eating particular foods, eating at particular times of day, or eating in particular places. Once you choose something to focus on, bring to mind that this habit or obstacle is shared by others. Imagine that your habit is representative of all others' habits. Reflect on this for a few moments periodically throughout your day.As you do this practice, keep in mind that you can and should simultaneously look for solutions to overcome the habit or obstacle. In fact, cultivating love and compassion in this way can help improve your ability to find a solution.Journal Reflection QuestionsDo you find that using your unhealthy habitual patterns as a source for seeing fundamental love and compassion changes the way you experience them? Does it create space for relating to them in a different way?Tip\nTransformation begins with honestly reflecting on how things are. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations Summary\" data-href=\"2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.2 transforming difficult situations, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.2 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transforming Difficult Situations: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transforming_Difficult_Situations_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475470,"modifiedTime":1759272587021,"sourceSize":4596,"sourcePath":"1.

In this section, we will work with transforming difficult situations. Of course, needless to say, difficult situations are something that we all experience. It may be that we experience them within our families. It may be that we experience difficult situations in our workplace with our colleagues or a specific project that we are working on. And it seems like maybe the most common response to difficult situations is that we either try to avoid them, not getting involved, or we try to fight them. However, as we will come to see in the teachings in this section, they do not have to be our only two options. There is another option where we can go from difficult situations being an obstacle to our life to them really becoming a support for our lives and our practice. In my own life, I came in contact with these teachings and with Mingyur Rinpoche in my early twenties, so I have had some time to practice this. That, of course, does not mean that I do not experience difficult situations anymore or that I always remember the practice when these difficult situations appear. I, too, forget. But the most transformative aspect of this is that, when I do remember awareness in these moments, I have an option. I have an option to take a step back, embrace the situation with awareness, and see what happens then. Or, of course, I have the option to try to avoid the situation or fight it. Of course, that is also an option. But the point here is that just to have an option to begin with has been, for me, the most transformative aspect of these teachings and practice in my own life. This, of course, comes down to having received these teachings and having recognized awareness for ourselves. And, for most people, that is not an option because they have not received the teachings or are not aware of this awareness inherent within themselves that they can recognize and that is so close. I think there is a lot of good material here in this section. I am really looking forward to seeing or hearing from you about your experience. And I hope you enjoy the teachings, meditations, and practices here. Please share your experience in the forum, and we will continue the conversation there. All the best in your practice. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations View\" data-href=\"2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.2 transforming difficult situations, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Transforming Difficult Situations (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Transforming_Difficult_Situations_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475460,"modifiedTime":1759272587029,"sourceSize":2955,"sourcePath":"1.

Again, in the beginning, it is very important to start with a small difficult situation. If you just broke up with someone, it might not be a good idea to try to transform this because, in the beginning, you might feel such strong emotions. That is actually a good sign, but you may feel overwhelmed. Try something very easy to transform first, an easy situation, or obstacle. If you just lost your job and you right away try to transform this, it might not be a good idea. Of course, you know yourself better than I do, so you can try it, why not? But remember that it sometimes feels like it is getting worse, and when you feel like this, it is a good sign. Do not worry about it, but you can come back to a small or easy one. The important thing is that you even want to transform these things, even though you cannot transform them yet. The intention, the wanting, and even the process of trying are good. That is already a lot! It is beneficial. Now, we will try this together. There are three steps. The first is to be aware of the situation, whatever situation you are facing, or the obstacle. And in this case, it is easy, right? If you lost your job, you know you lost your job. This — the situation or environment — is easier than being aware of emotions. First, just be aware of that. Let's try this together. First, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, please try to understand that whenever you face obstacles or problems, you will not feel at ease. We all feel discomfort and unhappiness. Try to connect with the feelings of others who are having similar problems. Connect with them. They all want to be free from this problem. They want to be happy, the same as you. Practice love and compassion a little bit. [Silent meditation] Now, use your own problem as the representation of all beings' problems. Take all beings' problems into your own problem. Wish that all beings be free from their problems. \"May my problem be the representation of all beings' problems.\" If you want, you can practice taking and sending with your breath. [Silent meditation] Feel happy that you are willing to do this practice. You are willing to transform your problem into loving-kindness and compassion. Even if you cannot transform it, feel happy that you wish to transform your problem into loving-kindness and compassion. Feel gratitude and feel happy about this. Appreciate it. Now, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay. 15 minutes of formal meditation every day\n75 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be as it is. There is no need to follow experiences or to try to block them. Just let everything be, and rest in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind a situation that is challenging. Do not start with the most provocative one. Instead, think of something that causes some fear and anxiety but is not overwhelming.&nbsp;\nFor a few minutes, reflect on the challenges and problems that arise from this situation and the suffering that surrounds it, and see what is present in your awareness.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind other beings and reflect on the fact that they, too, experience challenges in their lives and that they, too, want to be free from pain, discomfort, and stress.&nbsp;\nImagine that, by experiencing challenging situations, you alleviate the challenges that others face. If it is helpful, you can use a phrase like this: \"May I experience this difficulty on behalf of all beings so that they may be free from such problems.\"&nbsp;\nAs you reflect in this way, you can also imagine that you breathe in the suffering of others in the form of dark smoke, merging it with your own pain and suffering. While doing this, imagine that it alleviates others' pain and suffering. Periodically, rejoice in your hardships becoming the cause of ease for others.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, let go of the reflection, and let the mind be, as it is, in the present moment. When you feel it is supportive to do so, return to the practice and continue.&nbsp; End session Let go of the reflection, imagination, and phrases, dropping the practice and resting in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to rejoice in the fact that you were not only able to be with your own difficulties, but also use them as opportunities to cultivate love, compassion, and empathy.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone, everywhere.

This is another practice of self-transformation, or self-liberation with obstacles, situational problems, or environmental problems. Maybe you lost your job. Maybe you have physical or health problems, and you are sick. Maybe you have a relationship problem with your partner, your parents, or your colleagues. Or maybe there is an environmental problem wherever you are, like an earthquake, a flood, or different disasters that you may experience. When these things come into our life, normally we begin to hate, resist, or trying to escape them. Sometimes we surrender. Actually, all the great insight, all the great success, comes from problems. When you look at history, all the success stories come from difficult situations with problems or obstacles. When I was young, my father used to tell me about how we all have this great innate nature, but we do not know how to connect with it. We connect when we learn and study, then we can discover our fundamental nature. Or when we do something and connect with it through the experience. But the best is to connect with it through obstacles and problems. Then we can really try our best and use our talents, knowledge, capacity, and everything. My father used to say, \"If you are going somewhere and reach a dead-end, the first thing you do is take off your backpack and throw it to the other side.\" Once your backpack is gone, then you will use your knowledge, skills, capability, wisdom, and all this within you, right? And you can make it. You will cross, maybe not directly, but there are different ways you can find it. For example, in my hometown in Nepal, a big earthquake came. After I finished my retreat, the first time that I saw my monastery, it was cracked everywhere, and some of the walls had fallen down. At first, I was shocked. \"Huh!\" Then I thought, \"Oh, this is impermanent.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] \"Impermanence\" does not mean that everything is always changing and then there is nothing more to it. \"Impermanence\" means \"changing,\" but change allows you to access many different directions, opportunities, and new possibilities, actually. Impermanence helps us to see all these things. I thought about a creative plan for my new monastery. Now, in my monastery, we have a very nice project, and it is going to benefit many people. In a way, the earthquake was an obstacle, but for us, it became an opportunity. My hometown is right in the middle of the Himalayan mountains, and after the earthquake people from many different parts of the world came to help. The people in my hometown are now really grateful for this situation. And some of my students came and said at first that they had broken up with someone and that they were very upset and cried. But after a few years, they said, \"Wow! That breakup was wonderful! Now I have a new partner,\" and they were really appreciative of what happened afterward. They learned and grew more. Some people lost their jobs and then, a few years later, said, \"Wow! That was a great opportunity for me. I lost that job, and now I found this new job,\" or \"I looked for a new idea, and then I found an even better solution for my life,\" or something like that.Normally, obstacles and all these difficult situations can be transformed. Actually, there is no real obstacle if you do not give up [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] if you connect with the fundamental qualities within you and go forward. Of course, letting go is not giving up, right? In the same way, with love and compassion meditation, everything can be transformed into love and compassion. Here, we will transform difficult situations into love and compassion. How to do that? I will teach you in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche presents two ways of relating to obstacles in your life: 1) with resistance and/or fear; 2) with openness and receptivity. In the latter approach, obstacles can transform into opportunities. Do you see examples in your life in which this is true? Moments in which you might not have seen all the potential of a situation from the start? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche mentions a piece of advice his father gave to him: when you reach an obstacle on the trail, throw your bag over first and then figure out how to cross. What do you think is the significance of this story? Points to remember:\nSelf-transformation means using the obstacle itself as its own solution and an object of awareness\nBy changing your perspective, obstacles can become supports for your practice\nAfter the earthquake in Nepal, many people were surprised at how much their lives improved\nImpermanence is not just about change, but also about new opportunities\nInquiry\nHave particular obstacles in your life ended up presenting new opportunities?\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout the relationship between wisdom and application\nthe importance of experiential learning\nabout a traditional Buddhist story illuminating the importance of practice Joyful Wisdom, pp. 123-125 (Ch. 6, \"Tools of Transformation\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations Meditation\" data-href=\"2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.2 Transforming Difficult Situations, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.2 transforming difficult situations, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.2 View","throw your backpack over the wall","backpack analogy"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Transforming Difficult Situations: View (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Transforming_Difficult_Situations_View_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transforming Difficult Situations: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transforming_Difficult_Situations_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.2-transforming-difficult-situations-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475441,"modifiedTime":1759272587047,"sourceSize":6751,"sourcePath":"1.

This love is there with you, and maybe we can say that it is just a subtle sensation. We all have this subtle sensation within us, even when we go to sleep. The sensation in the body is awake, even when we go to sleep. It is there throughout the body. At the same time, love and compassion are always there throughout our bodies. And they are the essence of every emotion and thought. Next time you go into daily life, what you have to do is just connect with that feeling. Or you may find that it is just a motivation or the urge to be happy and free from suffering. Connect with that and do not worry about whom you love — yourself, lovers, a neutral person, or all beings. There is no need to worry about the object. With innate love, sometimes there is neither object nor concept. You can experience it, but you may not find the words. Especially when you are facing difficult emotions, just look at the fundamental level of that emotion. When you are facing a difficult situation, you do not like that difficult situation, and you want to be free from it, right? It is very strong then. Do not worry about what you want to be free from or what you want to achieve. Just go to the bottom or essence of that emotion, and you can find it. Try this in your life, and you can always try it with something easy. Transforming all these strong emotions and difficult situations into love and compassion has two layers. In the first, the surface layer, we are always looking for an object, making sense of it, or giving it meaning and labels. \"Okay, I am going to take all beings' emotions into my emotions.\" That is the surface level. That you cannot have all the time. You have to generate that, and sometimes you can, sometimes you cannot. And the second layer is more about connecting with the fundamental love and compassion and just being with that feeling. You do not have to create it. It is just there with you. But it takes time to experience this. If the second practice does not make sense to you or is not easy for you to grasp now, it is okay. Do not worry. Just understand this practice a little bit. Wanting to connect with the practice is already good.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesEvery emotion you feel, every movement you make, every situation you find yourself in is an expression of fundamental love and compassion. The practice in this section is to connect with this fundamental love and compassion. It will most likely not have an object, and the details may seem unclear, but, nonetheless, this fundamental love and compassion is always present. All you need to do is notice it. Take a few moments to recognize this driving force.Journal Reflection QuestionsMingyur Rinpoche explains that compared to the surface level practices—such as those found in courses 1‒3 of this level—recognizing the fundamental love present in every moment can be confusing. As you explore this practice, do you find any particular strategies that make it easier to experience this in your daily life? If so, please explain.Inquiry\nCan you be equanimous in your relationship with yourself?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love Summary\" data-href=\"2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.3 recognizing innate love, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.3 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Recognizing Innate Love: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Recognizing_Innate_Love_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475429,"modifiedTime":1759272587065,"sourceSize":4285,"sourcePath":"1.

The title of this part is \"Innate Love.\" And I wanted to invite you to take a moment and see what comes up for you when you hear this.\nFor me, it just really connects with a very deep longing. It is something that really inspires my mind because this is speaking to something very deep inside. What we are going to do here is really to come back to something that we have been around several times and to get instructions for looking at our own situation moment by moment and seeing how love is never missing — seeing how love is really something that is innate, something that cannot be separated from us or our experience — but that it is all just a matter of not recognizing it. We have been working with transforming different situations and different emotions. Here, we see how just recognizing how love is already present is a kind of transformation, but it is also something that I experience as extremely healing because it really gives that sense of trust and empowerment, just knowing that this is something that we already have. So, we are continuing with practices that are very powerful and that may be challenging at times because we are working with challenging situations and emotions. Again, we can just remember to do it in a way in which we are taking good care of ourselves.

The best transformation is no transformation. The meaning of this is that we all have fundamental love and compassion 24/7. Therefore, while having difficult emotions, we have that. While having difficult situations, we have that. And in fact, when we have difficult situations, when we are facing difficult situations, and when we are feeling difficult emotions, actually love and compassion are also very strong. In the traditional example, we say that where there is a more difficult emotion, blazing like a fire, wisdom is also blazing like a fire. When we go back to the example of the waves of the ocean, wherever the waves go, the ocean goes, or the water goes, right? If the volume of the waves is very high, then the volume of the water is also high in those waves, because the waves are water. Now, what we are going to do is just connect with love when we are feeling difficult emotions and facing difficult situations. When we are having difficult emotions, why do we feel these difficult emotions? Because of love and compassion. Without love and compassion, we cannot feel it. Even with hatred, right? Why does hatred come? We feel like something is not right. Our deeper feeling is just wanting to be happy, free, good, authentic, genuine, and nice. The feeling is just there. Then, we filter it through the conceptual mind, the dualistic mind, and it translates into hatred and suffering. Then, love becomes sectarian, black and white — so many different things. Now, we just connect with the fundamental feeling. And that feeling is so strong within you. That feeling is the nature of hatred, panic, stress, depression, and of course happiness, excitement, and joy. It is infused in all emotions. It is even infused in every thought, every movement of your body, every breath, and every blink of the eyes. Maybe you can find love and compassion as something completely pervasive in yourself, your entire body, your entire mind, and all of your feelings. Let's see. Now, we are going to practice this together. First, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, be aware of whatever strong emotions or difficult situations you are facing now. The feeling of this difficult emotion, or the experience of this difficult situation, is coming from love — the love that just wants to be happy, free, genuine, and good. Do not worry about the objects; Do not worry about love for whom or what; do not worry about love for yourself, others, loved ones, or other beings. Even if there is no object, it is okay. Genuine love is there. It is just a feeling. It is just a motivation sometimes, or sometimes just a belief. Sometimes, it is just the urge of wanting to be free and have happiness. [Silent meditation] This love is everywhere. This love is the essence of your existence. Of course, you may not identify it through concepts. In that case, just be in that state. [Silent meditation] Okay, now rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay. 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNotice how even assuming your posture is an expression of love and compassion: you are doing it because you want to be happy and free from suffering. As always, feel free to close your eyes or keep them open.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be as it is. There is no need to follow experiences or to try to block them. Just let everything be, while resting in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Reflect on the very fact that you are doing this practice. Notice how taking time out of your day to engage in this practice is, in itself, an expression of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind a challenging situation. Do not pick the most difficult one to start. Find something that is challenging, but workable. Reflect on what thoughts, reactions, emotions, and so on come up when you bring this situation to mind.\nAs these memories, reactions, and feelings come up, see if you can pause and explore them. Notice what they actually feel like: What is happening in your body? Your mind? See if you can notice the subtle thoughts and feelings that surround this situation.&nbsp;\nNext, take a step back and see if you can gain some perspective on the situation. Notice how underlying all of this—whether considering the situation itself or the accompanying feelings, thoughts, and emotions—is the wish to be happy and free from suffering, the wish to be content and at ease. See if you can notice this.&nbsp;\nAre there subtle ways that you engage with yourself that help increase your well-being and happiness? Perhaps there are tools you use in difficult situations that help you gain perspective. Reflect for a few minutes on these aspects of your experience.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, let go of the reflection, and let the mind be, as it is, in the present moment. When you feel it is supportive to do so, return to the practice and continue.&nbsp;\nNext, reflect on a situation in which you were not at your best. See if you can notice how even these moments are rooted in love and compassion. At your core, and in all situations, the basis for acting is love and compassion, even if the expression is confused.&nbsp; End session Let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains that innate love is often simply a feeling, an urge to be happy. It can be difficult to identify. As you engage in this practice, are you able to recognize signs of your innate love that are not obvious at first glance?Mingyur Rinpoche explains that the dualistic mind—that which creates subject and object, self and other, etc.—is the primary culprit of misunderstanding your true nature. As things slow down and you engage in this practice, are you able to better see examples of this? If so, please explain.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love Application\" data-href=\"2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.3 Meditation","love without object","objectless love"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Recognizing Innate Love: Meditation (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Recognizing_Innate_Love_Meditation_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Recognizing Innate Love: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Recognizing_Innate_Love_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475422,"modifiedTime":1759272587079,"sourceSize":7803,"sourcePath":"1.

But actually, you do not need to transform them. They are already transformed from the beginning. We say, \"The best transformation is no transformation.\" No transformation is the best transformation. A traditional example of this is what we call \"waves of the ocean.\" If you do not know the waves as waves, then, for you, they become like monsters — monsters that are chasing after you. Or it could be a landslide or anything scary. But if you know waves as waves, you know they are water and part of the ocean, and you can play with them and enjoy the view. Then the waves are very nice, not monsters or landslides. The waves become your friends. Seeing waves as monsters or seeing them as water, as a part of the ocean, depends on your perspective. But the water is just water. The waves are just waves — they do not change. These emotions, suffering, difficult situations, or what you are facing now — whether these are difficult situations or emotions or not depends on how you look at them. For practitioners or meditators, they are really opportunities. And they are the \"water,\" actually. They are love; they are compassion; they are wisdom; they are awareness. Maybe I will tell you a story about one of my students. When he was young, he did not like water. He hated water! He especially did not like going on the beach. When the waves came, he hated it. But his parents loved going to the beach near the water. So, he always had this problem. Then, when he became an adult and went to university, all of his friends loved to go to the beach and the water. He wanted to go with his friends, but as he did not like the water, it was very difficult for him. Then, he tried to really learn how to be with the water. He tried to encourage himself and to be comfortable with the water and play a little bit with small waves. In the end, he became a very good surfer. He went to Tahiti, and he surfed there. Eventually, he got a great opportunity to be part of a sports team and made a lot of money. And now he says, \"The waves are my friends, not my enemies.\" Similarly, all these emotions are like waves of the ocean. What is their nature? It is water, it is the ocean. Their nature is awareness, love, compassion, and wisdom. When we connect with the ocean itself, then we do not need to transform the waves. The transformation happens in your mind — the monsters become your friends. This is the real meaning of \"self-transformation.\" No transformation is the best transformation, meaning that you do not need to do anything with the waves. You do not need to transform the waves. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] This is the practice we are going to do, so I will teach it to you in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche discusses a story of a young man who grows up despising the ocean only to develop a deep love for it in his adult life. In fact, he becomes a professional surfer. How is this example illustrative of transforming challenges into your friends on the path?\nPoints to remember:\nbest transformation = no transformation\njust as the waves of the ocean are constituted by the ocean itself, your \"difficulties\" are expressions of your true nature\nyour perspective determines how you experience your life\nInquiry\nAre you able to see your true nature in challenges?\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow to transform challenges into possibilities\nabout your true nature\nhow intention is vital in practice\nabout the role of choice Joyful Wisdom, pp. 265–270 (Ch. 12, \"Joyful Wisdom\") <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love Meditation\" data-href=\"2.4.3 Recognizing Innate Love Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.3 View","the best transformation is no transformation","no transformation is the best transformation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Recognizing Innate Love: View (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Recognizing_Innate_Love_View_(6_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Recognizing Innate Love: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Recognizing_Innate_Love_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.3-recognizing-innate-love-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475405,"modifiedTime":1759272587094,"sourceSize":4732,"sourcePath":"1.

I would like to give you a practice. When you wake up in the morning, set an intention. Normally, our life is like the stock market; it goes up and down. Our life is like a wave of the ocean, moving up and down. That is normal. No matter if it goes up or down, from the level of awareness, love, and compassion, they all are the same. They all are manifestations of love, compassion, and awareness. They all are displays of that. They all are dynamic manifestations of your fundamental nature. Try to see that. For particular homework, maybe when you go to your work, there are colleagues that normally are not favorites of yours. You really do not like your colleagues. Or you might have a boss who is quite difficult for you. And you are going to meet them. There is a feeling of uneasiness and tension, right? After finishing your work, maybe you are going to meet your best friend to have tea or coffee or go to the beach, which is a pleasant event. See that, during these two events, they are equal. These are equal from the perspective of awareness, love, and compassion. Accept both and see that, at the fundamental level, they are equal. Try that. Of course, it is not so easy, and at the beginning, you will forget also, but remember your intention. Just having the intention to recognize that is already wonderful.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesThe essence of equanimity practice is to recognize that, from the perspective of the fundamental wish to be happy and free from suffering, all experiences are equal. In service of this goal, throughout this week, choose two relationships in your life to practice with. The first should be one that causes you some level of difficulty, and the second should be one with someone with whom you experience joy and happiness. Cultivate the intention to watch your internal experience as you encounter these two people. Shortly after spending time with them, take a moment to reflect on what happened. Regardless of whether or not it feels possible, cultivate the intention to recognize that your experiences in both of these situations are expressions of the same fundamental wish to be happy and free from suffering.Journal Reflection Questions\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that even resistance to people you do not like is an expression of love and compassion. For example, the wish to leave an uncomfortable situation is predicated on the wish to be happy and free from suffering. As you engage with others through this lens, does your experience of them change? If so, please explain.&nbsp;\nIn addition to the previous question, does your experience of how you view yourself change?\nMingyur Rinpoche reminds us that simply setting the intention to be aware of fundamental equanimity is sufficient. This is the principle of \"zero meditation,\" as mentioned previously in this course. How (if at all) does taking this perspective change your approach to the practice?\nInquiry\nCan you be equanimous in your relationship with yourself?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity Summary\" data-href=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.4 Basic Goodness As Equanimity, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.4 basic goodness as equanimity, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.4 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Basic Goodness as Equanimity: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Basic_Goodness_as_Equanimity_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475389,"modifiedTime":1759272587106,"sourceSize":4280,"sourcePath":"1.

And welcome back. Right now, we are in the middle of the course, and we have received quite a bit of teaching on transformation and transforming everything into love and compassion and so forth. In this section, we will dive deeper into basic goodness and equanimity. Of course, what this means you will find out in the teachings themselves. But I will just talk a little bit about these aspects and my experience in my own life.\nFor me, when I have experienced this quality of equanimity, it has been really helpful in my own practice because I think, for many of us in our practice, maybe we do not see results so much. Or it is quite subtle and happens over time. But when it happens, when we get an experience of the quality of equanimity... In my case, it has been, for example, sitting with sadness in my practice, and then when sadness comes over me, at the same time, there can be joy and happiness, a feeling of being completely okay, which is quite an interesting feeling in itself — to be sad and happy at the same time, so to speak. But when this happens, I think it can be really helpful and has been helpful to me to just see what effect engaging in these teachings and practices and meditating in this way has on our lives.\nAlso, from there, once we have experienced this for ourselves, then this step is not so far from where we start to sense how wonderful it would be if others could experience this as well. Or we could say that when we experience this for ourselves it can really give a spark of compassion for others.\nI think if everyone could experience a more equanimous outlook on the world, how wonderful would that be. Of course, for most of us, it is not available because we have not received these teachings, and we do not know about awareness or how to connect with awareness. And from there, as I said, for those of us who have experienced that and have recognized it, that can spark a sense of compassion and wishing for everyone to experience this for themselves and what this would do to the world.\nIn the teachings and practices in this section, I think there are quite a few jewels. And I am really looking forward to seeing and hearing from you what your experience is with these teachings and practices. So, please share your experience in the forums, and we can continue the conversation there. All the best in your practice. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity View\" data-href=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.4 Basic Goodness As Equanimity, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.4 basic goodness as equanimity, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Basic Goodness as Equanimity (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Basic_Goodness_as_Equanimity_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475378,"modifiedTime":1759272587112,"sourceSize":3075,"sourcePath":"1.

In this practice, you are connecting with the equanimity that is with you all the time. And you do not have to make a special equanimity practice. There is no need to particularly meditate on it; it is more like just recognizing it. We will practice this together. First, rest your mind in open awareness meditation. [Silent meditation] Now, please be aware that the sense of equanimity is there with you. It does not matter if you are feeling good or bad. Feeling good comes from love, compassion, and awareness. Feeling bad is also coming from love, compassion, and awareness. \"Right\" is also coming from love, compassion, and awareness. And \"wrong\" is coming from love, compassion, and awareness. [Silent meditation] From the level of your fundamental nature, they are always equal. There is great equanimity that is right there within you. And this equanimity is pure, really peaceful, and beyond concept. Just be in that state and accept it. Appreciate that your nature is wonderful. And there are no mistakes for this equanimity. We are safe in this equanimity.\nAnd now, thank this equanimity for having this wonderful gift. It is not only within you, but exists within all beings. [Silent meditation] Now, please rest your mind in open awareness again. [Silent meditation] Okay. 20 minutes of formal meditation every day\n120 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be as it is. There is no need to follow experiences or to try to block them. Just let everything be, while resting in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice See if you can recognize the all-pervasive quality of equanimity. It is what allows your experience to unfold. It encompasses that which is pleasing and that which we dislike; that which is \"good\" and that which is \"bad.\" See if you can acknowledge and appreciate this aspect of your experience.\nNotice how this equanimity allows for anything to arise. It includes everything and is free from attachment and aversion. It is unswayed and deeply accepting of things just as they are.&nbsp;\nIf it is helpful, you can use the phrase: \"May I dwell in great equanimity, free from attachment and aversion.\"&nbsp;\nSee if you can rest in the acceptance that exists before judgment—an openness that does not discriminate. It is naturally peaceful and beyond concepts, part of your basic goodness.\nFinally, rejoice in this quality, remembering that it is shared by all beings everywhere.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, let go of the reflection, and let the mind be, as it is, in the present moment. When you feel it is supportive to do so, return to the practice and continue.&nbsp; End session Let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains that the essence of equanimity practice is acceptance—acceptance of whatever is present in your experience, whether it is good or bad, right or wrong, wholesome or unwholesome. The reasoning he provides for this is that all of your experiences are expressions of the desire to be happy and free from suffering. As you engage in this practice of receptive recognition, does the way you relate to your experience change? If so, please explain.Can you see how the desire to be happy and free of suffering is present in one of your more negative emotions? Explain how.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity Application\" data-href=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.4 Basic Goodness As Equanimity, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.4 basic goodness as equanimity, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Basic Goodness as Equanimity: Meditation (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Basic_Goodness_as_Equanimity_Meditation_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Basic Goodness as Equanimity: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Basic_Goodness_as_Equanimity_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475370,"modifiedTime":1759272587116,"sourceSize":5314,"sourcePath":"1.

We can lose touch with it, but it cannot be destroyed.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe fundamental level of equanimity\nthe role of acceptance in the practice of equanimity\nthe relationship between equanimity and the other three immeasurables\npure perception\nWatch Read\nEquanimity is also part of our basic innate qualities. The key point of equanimity is acceptance. What do we need to accept? We are accepting good and bad. On the level of equanimity, they are the same. We are accepting right and wrong; for equanimity, they are the same. We are accepting enemies and best friends; for equanimity, they are the same. It sounds strange, right? \"If good and bad are the same and right and wrong are the same, then I can do whatever I want.\" But actually, it is not like that. Until now, we have learned a lot about awareness, love, compassion, joy, and also wisdom. All of these are about our innate qualities and who we are. From, let's say, the level of innate love and compassion, if you feel that something is right, that is a manifestation of love and compassion, if you feel that something is wrong, it also comes from love and compassion. If you feel hatred, it is also a manifestation of love and compassion. If you feel love, it is also a manifestation of love and compassion. Everything is in that state. Do you remember when we talked about the sky and the clouds? The sky is innate love, compassion, wisdom, awareness — all of these. And then right and wrong, hate and love, or whatever other normal feelings are the clouds. Whatever cloud appears is the same for the sky. A beautiful cloud or an ugly cloud — for space, they are the same. It does not matter. A blue sky with the sun shining, or a thunderstorm or hurricane with floods or rain showers is the same for the sky. That is the practice of equanimity. Actually, equanimity is there with you. At the fundamental level, everything is the same. In other words, this is what we call \"pure perception.\" Everything is pure. Everything is love, compassion, wisdom, and awareness. It is pure. From that level, everything is equal. That is the practice of equanimity. This equanimity is there with you — you do not have to create or make it. But you have to recognize this equanimity. To do that, you have to accept more and expand your mind more, again and again. Just like with love and compassion, to go through a few steps, you have to open up more and more. How to connect with that is the practice of equanimity. We will practice this in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nHow is equanimity different from nihilism or not caring? Question 2\nNo matter how many clouds arise in the sky, they have no effect on the sky itself. In the same way, Mingyur Rinpoche explains that, no matter how many afflictive emotions arise, they have no effect on your basic nature. This example highlights the fact that fundamental equanimity is already present with you from the beginning. How would you explain this metaphor (and its meaning) to a friend? Points to remember:\nThe fundamental level of equanimity is present 24/7\nacceptance is the essence of equanimity practice\nequanimity is inherent within the practice of the other three immeasurables: love, compassion, and joy\npure perception = seeing innate goodness in all activities\nTip\nThere is no need to create equanimity; it is already present within you.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout the traditional Tibetan term for \"meditation\"&nbsp;\nhow acknowledging what is already present in your experience is connected to the essence of meditation\nabout the tendency to privilege conceptual ideas over actual experience\nabout the role of mindfulness in meditation\nhelpful examples from Mingyur Rinpoche's life that illuminate the practice of meditation Joyful Wisdom, pp. 15-21 (Ch. 1, \"Making Friends\") <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity Meditation\" data-href=\"2.4.4 Basic Goodness as Equanimity Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.4 Basic Goodness As Equanimity, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.4 basic goodness as equanimity, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Basic Goodness as Equanimity: View (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Basic_Goodness_as_Equanimity_View_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Basic Goodness as Equanimity: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Basic_Goodness_as_Equanimity_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (12 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(12_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.4-basic-goodness-as-equanimity-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475357,"modifiedTime":1759272587131,"sourceSize":4785,"sourcePath":"1.

When you are connecting with your best friend, what you have to do is looking through the eyes of someone with a different perspective — through the eyes of your best friend's best friend, or the eyes of someone who is not really your best friend's best friend. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nWhen you do that, the perspective is different. Actually, there are no biases. Normally, we have a lot of biases depending on our beliefs, etc. Neuroscientists say that normally what we perceive is 95% in our head, and what we newly perceive from the reality outside is only 5%. So, you have a pre-concept, and based on that you judge, react to, and interact with other people.\nIf you do this practice, it really helps to free these biases. Next time you are going to meet your best friend, do this practice. But I do not mean that you have to see your best friend as your enemy or something like that. I do not mean that you have to act weird. Nothing like that. Just keep this in your mind and practice it.\nIf you are going to meet a person whom you do not like, do this same practice. At the basic level, their awareness, compassion, wisdom, and love are the same. All people have them, and you have them. So, my wish is that you can see their true nature and be free from biases.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesChoose someone in your life who you like. The next time you go to visit with this person, try to see them through the eyes of someone who loves them. Then, after a few minutes, try to see them through the eyes of someone who hates them. Reflect on the difference between these two and take note. On a different day, you can also try this with someone you do not like or with a neutral person.Journal Reflection Questions\nAs you see others through a variety of perspectives, how does this impact the way you experience them? Does it increase the love and compassion you have for them? Or perhaps it decreases? In either case, please explain.&nbsp;\nMingyur Rinpoche reports that neuroscientists believe over 95% of our \"reality\" is actually based on our biases, and less then 5% is based on what actually exists. Does hearing this impact your experience?\nTip\nRecognize that views and opinions are simple a matter of one's own perspective.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.5 Love and Hate Summary\" data-href=\"2.4.5 Love and Hate Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.5 Love And Hate, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.5 love and hate, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.5 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love and Hate: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_and_Hate_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475345,"modifiedTime":1759272587142,"sourceSize":3292,"sourcePath":"1.

This week, we are going to begin the exploration of the fourth of the qualities of the boundless heart, the quality of equanimity. Traditionally, equanimity is described as being free from attachment and aversion to those near or far. And, in a way, that can seem quite surprising because this is what we experience all the time, isn't it? We have either strong aversion or strong attraction, and, thinking about being free of that, it can almost seem that it would be unnatural. And yet, when we really take a closer look, we also see that this is what prevents us from actually having clarity and from actually seeing situations, ourselves, and others with clarity, because we get stuck on the surface level and on our immediate judgment. The lack of equanimity is actually what is preventing us from having clarity. And it is also what is preventing us from having genuine kindness and compassion because, when we have clarity and really see ourselves and others, that is also when joy, love, and compassion can flow freely. So this is a very interesting and very important exploration. And I look forward to hearing how it is unfolding for you. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.5 Love and Hate View\" data-href=\"2.4.5 Love and Hate View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.5 Love And Hate, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.5 love and hate, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.5 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Love and Hate (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Love_and_Hate_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475339,"modifiedTime":1759272587148,"sourceSize":1797,"sourcePath":"1.

Please keep your meditation posture, and first rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, think of a neutral person whom you do not particularly love or hate. See the great qualities within this person. That person has awareness 24/7, as well as love, compassion, and wisdom. That person has a lot of unique talents and skills.\n[Silent meditation]\nAt the same time, that person is seemingly making mistakes. They do not recognize all these qualities within themselves. Out of ignorance, they have craving, aversion, jealousy, and anger. Because of that, there is panic, depression, and low self-esteem.\nFollowing these emotions, they might carry out actions that are in turn followed by hatred and harming others. However, these negative emotions and actions are coming from their fundamental nature. To use the example of a wave: when this person fixates on the kleshas, it will produce negative actions, and they will perceive the wave as a monster. Connect with that person.\nNow, you can look through the eyes of that person's best friend. Imagine you are that person's best friend. Now, you will see more qualities within that person. \"Wow!\" You will see that this person is full of love, talents, and kindness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, change your perspective. Look at this person through the eyes of that person's enemy or someone who hates that person. Now, that person has completely changed. They are mean, bad, selfish, and untrustworthy. But actually, it is the same person.\n[Silent meditation]\nRecognize that these are all your projections. What we are making, love or hatred, it is our projection. Wish that the other person also realizes their fundamental equanimity and dissolves all love and hatred into this fundamental equanimity.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness. 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be as it is. There is no need to follow experiences or to try to block them. Just let everything be, while resting in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Bring to mind a neutral person, someone you do not have strong feelings toward. Notice that this person, like every individual, wants to be happy and free from suffering. Recognize that they have awareness, wisdom, and a capacity to learn and grow. Hold this person in mind by seeing these basic qualities.&nbsp;\nReflect on the fact that, just like you, this person makes mistakes and, at times, acts in harmful ways. This is inevitable. However, in their basic nature, they are good and pure and are endowed with wisdom, awareness, love, and compassion.&nbsp;\nThis is not intended to be an abstract reflection, but rather heart-felt. Think of ways that this person displays the fact that they are basically good and that they possess the fundamental qualities of awareness, wisdom, love, and compassion.&nbsp;\nNow, bring the same perspective to yourself. Notice how, at this very moment, you have awareness. This is part of your basic nature. Notice how this is with you all the time. Rest in this fact.&nbsp;\nSimilarly, you have many qualities like love and compassion, insight and wisdom, and have grown so much over your life. This is also part of your basic nature.&nbsp;\nReflect on moments in your past when you acted skillfully and unskillfully. Cultivate the understanding that no matter the situation, every moment is imbued with the basic qualities of awareness, wisdom, love, and compassion. Rest in this basic fact.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, let go of the reflection, and let the mind be, as it is, in the present moment. When you feel it is supportive to do so, return to the practice and continue.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind different people—including those you love and those who are challenging—and see them through the lens of basic goodness. Notice how, regardless of how they act, they each possess the fundamental qualities of awareness, wisdom, love, and compassion.&nbsp; End session Let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche suggests viewing a neutral person through the eyes of someone who loves them and someone who hates them.

Practicing equanimity at the fundamental level is really profound and powerful, but sometimes it is so easy that it becomes difficult. We are not able to feel it. We are not able to recognize it.\nNow, we are going to practice equanimity beginning with the conceptual level. For the next practice, we are going to make comparisons. First, we are going to choose a person who is neutral for us. We are going to see what the qualities of that person are and what mistakes that person is making. We are going to look at it as if we were that person's best friend. Then, we are going to look at it another way. Maybe we can look at that person through the eyes of that person's enemy.\nThe main reason we are doing this is that connecting with equanimity within us is sometimes not so easy. It is beyond concepts. But we use concepts to reason. Actually, it just depends on how you look at it.\nFor example, I like to eat chilies. In some countries, like Bhutan, chilies are the main dish. In some countries in Europe, they hate to eat chilies, right? When people who like to eat chilies first see chilies, they feel so happy. As for people who hate chilies, the moment they see the chilies, they are unhappy. But from the point of view of the chili, it is the same. It depends on how you look at it.\nFrom the fundamental level or our true nature, all of these, hate and love, are the same. We are going to recognize that, on the fundamental level, they all are equal. On the level of awareness, compassion, and love, they are all the same.\nWe are going to practice this together in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche uses the example of eating food with chilis in it. He explains that if you are from Bhutan, you will look favorably upon spicy food, whereas if you are from Europe, you may not. In terms of perspective, what does this example help illuminate? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that practicing the four immeasurables in general and equanimity specifically on the conceptual level helps to deepen your understanding of the nonconceptual level. How does this work? Please explain. Points to remember:\nthere are two forms of equanimity practice: fundamental (i.e. nonconceptual) and conceptual\nperspective is relative to each persons' experience and background\nputting yourself in another's shoes can help loosen your clinging to your particular perspective\nwhile entirely natural, comparison can influence the way you perceive others and your world\nTip\nOn the most fundamental level, all experiences are the same.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout the comparative mind\nhow much of your knowledge is relative\nabout the process of perception\nhow a distinct self arises based on mental images Joyful Wisdom, pp. 65–70 (Ch. 3: \"Relativity of Perspective\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.5 Love and Hate Meditation\" data-href=\"2.4.5 Love and Hate Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.5 Love And Hate, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.5 love and hate, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.5 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Love and Hate: View (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Love_and_Hate_View_(5_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Love and Hate: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Love_and_Hate_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.5-love-and-hate-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475324,"modifiedTime":1759272587171,"sourceSize":3954,"sourcePath":"1.

Normally, we might have some biases, and these things are on an unconscious level. We just bring awareness to that.\nAlso, you can interact more with people from other groups. If you find it easy, you can make friends with them. You can also help them if they need help. In a different group, you can do some social work. Try this!\nIn the beginning, you can do it on a small-scale level. Maybe if you go to the gym, you can try exercising in another group or in a different gym. You can see people and connect with them. They are also the same at a basic level.\nRegardless of your beliefs, or whatever group you are in, maybe you can connect with a group with different beliefs out there and make friends with them. It does not mean that you have to change your beliefs. You can have your beliefs but respect others. Respect others' faiths, beliefs, cultures, and backgrounds.\nIt is really important that we all do this together for a better, peaceful, and kind world.&nbsp;\nThank you!\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAs you go about your daily activities, see if there are opportunities to connect with people from different backgrounds and/or living situations than you. For example, when you go to the gym, perhaps you can join a group with people older than you, or from a different geographical area, or from a different ethnic background. As you engage with people outside your norm, see if you can cultivate understanding and openness to the characteristics that make them different from you. It is important that you are specific about which situation or at what time you are going to practice.Journal Reflection Questions\nAs you reflect on how all beings share in the same basic nature, how does this affect the way you relate to others? Specifically, when you meet someone from a different background and/or situation than you, does this view help you connect with them?\nMingyur Rinpoche suggests that opening your heart to people who may seem different from you on the surface can help bring more kindness and ease, not only into your own life, but to the world at large. As you engage in these practices, do you experience this to be true? If so, give an example from your own life.\nTip\nEquanimity practice includes opening your heart to other views and opinions.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.6 Equanimity for All Beings Summary\" data-href=\"2.4.6 Equanimity for All Beings Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.6-equanimity-for-all-beings-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.6 Equanimity For All Beings, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.6 equanimity for all beings, application - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.6 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Equanimity for All Beings: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Equanimity_for_All_Beings_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.6-equanimity-for-all-beings-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.6-equanimity-for-all-beings-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475307,"modifiedTime":1759272587184,"sourceSize":3721,"sourcePath":"1.

In this section, we will really take everything we have been doing up until this point to now include and embrace all beings.\nAnd, of course, this may sound like a really grand undertaking to include all beings in our practice. But really, if we take a moment and just take a step back and bring it back to our own practice and our own experience, of course we will see that we want to be happy and do not want to experience pain, discomfort, or suffering. And of course, this is also true for everyone else. Everyone wants to be happy, and no one wants to experience pain, discomfort, or suffering. When we see this, and when we also see the practice we have been doing in this course with transformation and equanimity and can see what effect those practices have in our own lives, maybe it is not too much of a stretch, actually, to see how wonderful it would be if everyone could experience this for themselves. And what could this do to the world if we had a more equanimous outlook?\nAs Mingyur Rinpoche will talk about in this section, and as I thought I would touch upon a little bit myself, when we engage with others or look at others, we often tend to focus on what separates us instead of focusing on what we have in common. And it is quite interesting because when we sit down with someone, of course, it may be that we have different religious or political views, different interests, or what have you. But when we sit down and talk with someone, I think quite often we start to see that we actually have quite a lot in common. And how would it be if, instead of focusing so much on what separates us, we started to focus on this — on what we have in common? What world and what environment would we have if we started to do that?\nI really think this section has a lot to offer, and in my own practice and in my own life, having this shift of perspective or starting to view people more in this light, or focusing on what I have in common with them, especially with those people that I disagree with, has really had a huge impact on me. Of course, I do not always manage to do that. Of course, there are situations or people that are really difficult. But just to have the intention or inspiration to try to do this and sometimes succeed in changing the perspective has, as I have found for my own life, a big impact.\nI think this section really has a lot to offer and a lot to offer for discussions, so I hope to see you in the forums. Please share your experience there, and we can continue the conversation.

Now, the really important point is to practice with whatever problem or suffering that you face and that others face in the world. The world does not become peaceful because of wrong beliefs. We do not recognize that, fundamentally, we are all the same.\nNow, we will do this practice on a bigger scale. Until now, we have done it person to person.\nNow, we are going to meditate. We have an \"in-group\" and an \"out-group,\" right? Imagine that your out-group is your in-group now. We will do this practice. It does not matter what cultural, race, or gender differences there are. Just imagine that you are of another gender, culture, or race. Then, try to see things from that perspective.\nFirst, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nPlease think of whoever your out-group is, according to your culture, country, sports team, political party, or race.\nNow, your out-group is your in-group. Look through the eyes of your out-group at your in-group — your previous in-group.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, your new in-group is the same as you. They want to be free and have happiness. At a basic level, we are all the same. Not only are your in-group and out-group the same at a basic level, but also all beings on the earth are the same.\nWish that all beings dwell in equanimity, free from attachment and hatred.\nMay the world be at peace. May all beings be at peace.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation] 25 minutes of formal meditation every day\n175 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Take a few moments to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice. Cultivate the noble heart that wishes to be of benefit to others. With this in mind, recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Let everything be as it is. There is no need to follow experiences or to try to block them. Just let everything be, while resting in awareness itself.&nbsp; Main practice Connect with all beings that you feel at odds with in some way. They may be different from you in ways that you do not like, or something about them may make you feel uneasy. Simply recognize these biases in your heart.&nbsp;\nNow, see if you are able to perceive the world through the eyes of these difficult people. They may see the world through a different lens than you, but, just like you, they want to be happy and free from suffering.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind those you hold dear. Recognize that they also wish to be happy and free from suffering.&nbsp;\nRecognize that, on a fundamental level, there is no difference between these two groups of people. They all share the same wish.&nbsp;\nHold this understanding in your mind and cultivate the wish that all people—including those who are challenging for you and those who are dear to you—may rest in and experience equanimity, free from attachment and aversion.&nbsp;\nIf it is useful, use this phrase: \"May all beings dwell in great equanimity, free from attachment and aversion to those near and far.\"\nAs you engage in this reflection, keep coming back to the fact that no matter how different people may appear to be, we all have basic goodness and share the wish to be happy and free from suffering.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, let go of the reflection, and let the mind be, as it is, in the present moment. When you feel it is supportive to do so, return to the practice and continue.&nbsp; End session Let go of the reflection, drop the practice, and rest in open awareness. If your eyes have been closed, slowly open them, and take in this moment with a sense of love and compassion.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche suggests imagining that you see the world through the perspective of those who are different from you. This includes those of different races, ethnicities, genders, geographical locations, and so on. When you engage in this practice, does it affect the way you see the world?Mingyur Rinpoche explains that all suffering and/or difficulties that you experience derive from biases and prejudices. In other words, it is through grasping and pushing away that suffering arises. As you reflect on this, does it ring true in your experience?

This practice is really important!\nIn the world, there are a lot of problems, right now. And most of these problems are based on biases, prejudices, and our wrong judgment, and based on not seeing that, on a fundamental level, we are all the same. We are all part of a big family. We are 90%, or maybe 95% or 99%, the same. We all want to be happy and free from suffering. We all have love, compassion, skills, and we all want to do our best. But there are a few differences. Our skin color might differ, our language might differ, and how we dress might differ. And because of these differences, we judge, and we fight for that. This then creates a lot of problems.\nWhen you look at world history, for example — World War I, World War II — all these wars are based on biases. They are based on not seeing the fundamental level, not connecting with that, and just following our wrong judgment. Then, we may think, \"Okay. I am making the world better,\" but that \"better world\" is a mistake. You cannot really make the world better by following hatred. You have to connect with love and compassion.\nTo practice equanimity with all beings, try to see that, on a fundamental level, we all are the same. Wish that all beings could recognize that, see that, and be free from biases, judgment, and feelings, emotions, and beliefs of inequality.\nWe are going to practice this in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche discusses how biases and prejudice lead to conflict. He gives examples of this on the global scale, i.e. World Wars I and II. On a more personal level, can you think of examples in which your own biases and/or prejudices lead to conflict? Question 2\nOnce again, Mingyur Rinpoche explains that all beings possess fundamental goodness, love, compassion, and various capabilities. Looking back on the course, are there strategies that you have developed that help you recognize this fact? Points to remember:\nEquanimity practice includes cultivating love and compassion for all beings\nBiases and prejudice lead to conflict\nAll beings, no matter their appearance, are the same on a fundamental level\nThrough love and compassion, you can promote beneficial change\nInquiry\nAre there biases and/or prejudices that are influencing your experience in this moment?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nabout the basic concerns shared by all beings\nabout the diverse strategies taken to remedy this basic concern\nhow all beings share basic goodness The Joy of Living, pp. 53-55 ( Ch. 3: \"Mind, Biology, or Both\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"2.4.6 Equanimity for All Beings Meditation\" data-href=\"2.4.6 Equanimity for All Beings Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.6-equanimity-for-all-beings-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["2.4.6 Equanimity For All Beings, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","2.4.6 equanimity for all beings, view - Tergar joy of living course","2.4.6 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Equanimity for All Beings: View (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Equanimity_for_All_Beings_View_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Equanimity for All Beings: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Equanimity_for_All_Beings_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.6-equanimity-for-all-beings-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-2/2.4/2.4.6-equanimity-for-all-beings-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475267,"modifiedTime":1759272587210,"sourceSize":3837,"sourcePath":"1.

Congratulations on finishing the Joy of Living Training! This is a really great achievement, and by now you have probably developed a daily habit of meditation, both on and off the cushion. You may wonder what you are going to do next or how you are going to continue with your meditation journey and practice. There are a few choices: those of you who are interested in exploring where the teachings and practices of the Joy of Living program come from can join our Vajrayana Online program. You do not have to be a Buddhist to participate in this program, but simply being interested in meditation and your own inherent qualities of awareness and basic goodness is enough. So, if you are interested in exploring this further, this may be a good alternative for you. There are also those of you who are interested in more Buddhist practices, and then the Vajrayana Online program, as mentioned, as well as our Path of Liberation program, will be a natural next step. But there are also those of you who are not particularly interested in Buddhism and do not want to participate in Vajrayana Online or Path of Liberation, and that is totally fine. To be honest, the Joy of Living program with its teachings and practice instructions from Mingyur Rinpoche is probably one of if not the most profound meditation program available out there. Personally, I have gone through the Joy of Living program and received these teachings from Rinpoche numerous times, online and in person. I have also gone through the Path of Liberation program, as well as developed the courses for Vajrayana Online and Joy of Living, and I must say that the clarity, simplicity, and profound way that Mingyur Rinpoche transmits these teachings of the Joy of Living series is just amazing to me. Rinpoche from the outset shares how our fundamental nature is good, pure, and completely perfect and that we can access and experience this through an awareness that has always been and always will be present within ourselves is truly remarkable. Simply resting in a moment of open awareness is like coming home. What are some practical steps that we can do now that we have finished the program? Well, the obvious thing is that we can always go back to the teachings in the levels and courses and watch and practice them again. This may sound somewhat silly upon completing a program: \"What? I am supposed to do it again?\" But the truth is that through our own practice and experience, when we return to these teachings again and again, we find or hear something new or we hear something differently from how we heard it the first time. As I said before, I have received these Joy of Living teachings from Rinpoche numerous times since 2008, but my understanding of the teachings continue to deepen as my practice evolves. So, I would strongly recommend that you return to the teachings again and again — they never get old. Another option is that you can join a local group, either in person or online, to team up with fellow Joy of Living students to exchange experiences and discuss the teachings of the program. These meetings tend to be highly beneficial, and it is amazing to connect with people who have the same interest in recognizing and deepening their understanding of awareness. You can also join the various Joy of Living events with Mingyur Rinpoche and instructors and facilitators that are being offered throughout the year in different locations and online. You can find all our events at&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://events.tergar.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://events.tergar.org/\" target=\"_self\">events.tergar.org(opens in a new tab)</a>. Last, but certainly not least, please participate in the Joy of Living webinars and meetings that are included in your subscription. This is an area in which we especially want to put some focus, so that we can continue to create a strong community of meditators and come together to reflect, discuss, and practice the teachings. With that, I hope that you stay with us and that I will see or hear from you in the forums, in one of our webinars or future practice sessions, or even in an event or local group. All the best and, again, congratulations on coming this far on your meditation journey!\nWatch Read\nHello everyone! Congratulations on completing all the Joy of Living courses.\nPerhaps some of you are already wondering what is next? While others of you are looking for ways to incorporate teachings into your daily life. Maybe you are so happy that these courses are finally over. Whatever you might be feeling right now is totally fine. I was reflecting on my journey on the path of awareness, compassion, and wisdom, and why I continue to stay on the path. The simplest way to describe my journey is that these teachings transformed my life, especially the way I relate to myself, others, and all the ups and downs of my life. And most importantly, even though my journey has lots of ups and downs, I learned that was totally normal. I can actually use my struggles as opportunities to deepen my practice, with the total acceptance of simply allowing. That space was so nurturing to me as a practitioner, and I began to trust the process. One of my meditation teachers says that talking about the teaching and practice is one thing, but living it is completely a different matter. I hold her message in my heart as I practice on the path, so that I am staying true and honest to my own exploration. My journey has not been linear at all, even though the courses are laid out as Levels 1, 2, and 3. But what I experienced is that I benefited so much from going back to these teachings again and again, because something different always speaks to my heart in a new way. Some of you might have already experienced that your motivation to practice waxes and wanes. At times I am super motivated to keep practicing longer, or to go off to personal retreats, and at other times I experience intense resistance to come to my meditation cushion. What I personally found helpful is the aspect of community. Thanks to having other people to share my experiences with, I was able to hear similar challenges and different insights and observations from others. It became one of my sources of inspiration to stay on the path. All of us on the Tergar team are hoping to continue to help support your learning. We will be creating more opportunities for you to meet other meditators and receive personal guidance from experienced meditation teachers. I hope that you enjoy connecting more with our learning community, and applying the teachings in your daily life, so that you will feel more completely at ease in your own skin, and with who you truly are. As always, we are here to support you on your journey, and you can reach out to us anytime. Thank you so much. I hope to see you all soon.\nTergar's Buddhist path includes two components: &nbsp;the Vajrayana Online learning platform and the Path of Liberation Training series.The Buddhist tradition is filled with rich practices and profound teachings that build on the principles of the Joy of Living and can directly inform how we live our lives. If you are curious about where the Joy of Living comes from, the Vajrayana Online courses are a great way to deepen your understanding.Investigating traditional Buddhist themes and topics, such as those covered in the Vajrayana Online courses, provides an opportunity to strengthen your motivation, gain insight into the nature of reality, and access greater freedom in your life.Great places to start in Vajrayana Online are:Foundations of Tibetan Buddhism\nThis course explores the rich history, philosophy, and meditative traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and how it can be applied in the modern world.\nThe Way of the Bodhisattva: Essence\nThis course explores one of the most treasured texts of the Buddhist tradition,&nbsp;The Way of the Bodhisattva&nbsp;by Shantideva. This exploration focuses on training the mind in awareness, loving-kindness and compassion, and wisdom in order to expand these qualities.\nThe Three Yanas\nThis course provides an overview of the three vehicles, or&nbsp;yanas,&nbsp;of Tibetan Buddhism. It takes an experiential and relatable approach, highlighting just how applicable these spiritual approaches are in our everyday lives.\nIf you are interested in exploring formal Buddhist practice, the Path of Liberation Training series is ideal for you. Building on the principles of the Joy of Living, in the Path of Liberation Mingyur Rinpoche presents profound Buddhist wisdom in a step-by-step path that can be easily integrated into everyday life.While the methods are different at times, the goal of the Path of Liberation is the same as the Joy of Living: discover our basic goodness. In this path, you will receive experiential guidance on how to first recognize the nature of mind and then stabilize this recognition so that it becomes a lived experience. These teachings and practices focus on bringing this understanding into your everyday life, including in your relationships, your work, and even the most mundane activities.&nbsp;Through practicing in the Path of Liberation, you will gain greater freedom, confidence, and understanding of who you are.The Path of Liberation is laid out in five levels. These levels are offered by Mingyur Rinpoche in retreats throughout the year. These events are available both in person and online. In each level, Mingyur Rinpoche provides pithy instructions on the nature of mind and introduces what are called the foundational practices, which use the imagination, contemplations, and movement exercises to explore topics such as generosity, devotion, and the mind of letting go.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://tergar.org/what-is-the-path-of-liberation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tergar.org/what-is-the-path-of-liberation\" target=\"_self\">Learn more about the Path of Liberation</a>Watch Read\nGreetings, everybody. This is Tim Olmsted, and as you probably know, I am one of the five Tergar instructors. I wanted to take a moment to congratulate you on having completed the three Joy of Living courses. As you know, these three courses have given you an excellent understanding of the view and practice of meditation, its expression as loving-kindness and compassion and, finally, an insight into the nature of reality, wisdom itself. These three form the basis for a subtle meditation practice for the rest of your life. Some of you might decide this is enough, that you have learned what you needed or wanted to learn. But many of you might be curious about what is next. You may want to learn more about how to go further with what you started and how to more fully integrate what you have learned into all aspects of your life — your own personal growth, your relationships with others, and even the experiences of aging and dying. If this is of interest to you, I invite you to explore our Vajrayana Online learning platform. On Vajrayana Online, you will find a variety of courses that cover a wide range of topics that will enrich and deepen your experience of the journey that you have begun, regardless of whether you think of yourself as a Buddhist or not. All of these courses are available at any time for you to take part in and are designed to be taken at whatever speed or depth appeals to you. There is always a course that is being presented in real time, while all of the other courses are there for you to enjoy at any time. For instance, an extensive course on the wonderful text, The Way of the Bodhisattva, written by the 8th-century monk/scholar Shantideva. This course is considered to be one of the primary resources for the exploration of the awakened heart, or bodhichitta, and the path of the bodhisattva. A bodhisattva is someone who has committed themselves to continuing along the path of awakening in order to be of benefit to others. For many of us, this aspiration grows naturally as our meditation practice and understanding of the nature of the human condition deepens. We also have courses that explore the life of the Buddha, a course on the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism, and a course on Vajrayana Buddhism. We have a course called the \"Three Yanas,\" which is a survey of the entire Buddhist tradition. This is recommended learning for anyone who wants a full understanding of the path. We have courses on the nature of retreat practice and courses on Buddhist philosophy. We also have several courses that are related to the art of living and dying mindfully. Each course offers teachings from Mingyur Rinpoche, introductions from one of the Tergar instructors, and readings from classical and modern texts, as well as articles and clips from contemporary teachers from a variety of Buddhist traditions and non-Buddhist traditions. We have periodic webinars with instructors or other teachers and commentators and periodic group practice sessions. Finally, for those who take part in Vajrayana Online, we offer the opportunity to have interviews with one of the Tergar instructors to talk about your practice, study, or anything that has come up along the way. So, we invite you to take a look and see if Vajrayana Online would be a fit for you. I also wanted to take a moment to share some thoughts on why study is so important and helpful. As you learned in Joy of Living Level 3, the true cause of freedom is wisdom, the ability to see oneself and the world clearly and accurately. This clarity allows us to live our life in a way that is balanced and deeply connected. Meditation helps us experience an open, relaxed, and flexible mind. It is with such a mind that we can deepen our understanding of ourselves, others, and the world around us. If our mind is open and tamed in this way, we can guide it and enrich it through learning and further training. In this way, our \"crazy monkey mind\" becomes a reliable and intelligent companion. Through further meditation practice and learning, we become more able to navigate our life, our ups and downs, our patterns and confusion, our hopes and fears, and our family, relationships, work, and community life. We learn how to heal and grow and to, in turn, support others in their own healing and growth. Perhaps another way of saying this is that further study and understanding allows us to bring the basic goodness that we have discovered through our meditation practice into the world in a way that can guide us and connect us with whomever we meet. Through further study, we can also develop a deeper understanding about the path ahead, the path of transforming our heart and mind, so that we can accomplish our aims in this life. The path of meditation is unpredictable. It goes up and it goes down. It is often boring or even hard to follow. Through study, we can develop a more subtle understanding about how the path unfolds. This allows us to keep a long view and an understanding of how to work with our heart and mind all along the way. Also, when we study we are able to connect with many of the remarkable men and women who have gone before us. Their commitment to the very journey that we are on can inspire us, uplift us, and give us a glimpse of what is possible along the path. Through them we can sense what is possible for people just like us who, over time, have themselves developed profound kindness, wisdom, courage, and the ability to touch and benefit whomever they meet. Simply knowing their example and knowing what is possible for us to experience along the path can give us a sense of the long haul, regardless of how things might seem on any given day. Finally, as you probably already know, there will be times when people will come to you asking for your insight and your guidance for how they might benefit from meditation practice and learning. Further learning will give you greater understanding and skill in how you might communicate some of what you have learned in a way that is appropriate, helpful, and clear. As well, learning and study, when combined with a consistent meditation practice, bring tremendous interest and curiosity into all aspects of our life, our heart, our mind, the people in our life, and the entire human community.

If we get caught up in our afflictions or try to repress them we just end up creating more problems for ourselves. If, instead, we look at them directly, the things we fear will kill us are gradually transformed into the strongest supports for meditation we could ever hope for. Mental afflictions are not enemies. They're our friends.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nConclusion by Mingyur Rinpoche Read\nNow, we have finished course one for level three. In this course, we discussed the general principle of level three. And it is really important to have an overview of level three first. The whole purpose of this practice is to recognize who we are, to discover our fundamental quality. The same as in level one, awareness is there all the time, and everything is in awareness. Awareness is like the sky. Then, all the thoughts, emotions, and perceptions — everything is in awareness, right? All these are like clouds, and all are in awareness. Now, here, it is the same; the wisdom is with us all the time, actually. The wisdom. As I mentioned before, even the unhealthy sense of self, in a way, is a manifestation of wisdom. Because the unhealthy sense of self perceives the self as single, independent, and permanent. And, in a way, there is truth in that. That is true. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Our true nature is oneness, right? And it is free — there is a quality of independence there. And there is a quality of not changing there. We do not call it \"permanent,\" but it does not change. And then, of course, we will explore this healthy sense of self more later, in more detail. Do not worry if you do not understand it at this stage. You may be a little bit confused. Confusion is always good in level three. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] And the healthy sense of self is getting closer to our nature. The healthy sense of self is closer to the luminous self, actually. There are many different aspects, many different pieces, and all are interdependent. There are a lot of causes and conditions, and all of these are related together. And then with time they are changing and changing. That is our life. And that is actually closer. You are seeing yourself more clearly when you see yourself that way. But you may not understand that completely now. Do not worry — we will go through it again and again later. Then, in the end, our true nature is the self beyond self or luminous self. That is the absolute level. This general overview is finished, and, hopefully, this will give you a glimpse or sense of level three, and you will continue on in the next courses. They will be really meaningful and will help to free up tightness. And the sensitive self will become more open and free. Thank you! Conclusion by Edwin Kelley Read\nThank you for participating in this first course in Joy of Living level three, Awakening Wisdom. In the ensuing courses, we will further explore the material that Rinpoche has already introduced here — specifically, this sense of how we create an unhealthy self and how we can realign our understanding with how things truly are so that we can strengthen a healthy sense of self. And this unhealthy and healthy sense of self are what we refer to as \"relative reality.\" And so much of this is really just realigning our understanding of how things are in accordance with how they truly are, and, in doing so, we diminish or mitigate our suffering. It is like we are no longer walking through life bumping into things or coming up against things not being in accordance with what we expect them to be. And then we also continue the exploration of this self beyond self or this pure self, or what we sometimes call \"pure awareness,\" or \"nonconceptual awareness.\" And these teachings relate to the ultimate truth. And I have found these teachings to be the most liberating. And so, strap yourself in — you are in for a wonderful ride. Please enjoy the journey, and I hope that in the process you will begin to unburden yourself from that which causes suffering in your life because your understanding becomes more aligned with or in accord with your true nature, how things truly are. Thank you very much. Conclusion by Kunsang Palmo Read\nIn my own experience, when ideas I had of what this practice should be did not pan out and my expectations fell away, the beginning of a new practice started to emerge. At times we might find ourselves in an uneasy space — not quite here, and not quite there — and in that space of not knowing, our mental constructs can start to unravel. The practice is like life — it is unpredictable and surprising. And when we can develop some continuity of mindful receptivity, we are able to flow with it. When we are willing to be in relationship with what is, we experience the wisdom in presence. We discover something about letting life be. As you work through the course, you will not resonate with everything, and that is perfectly okay. In his introduction, Edwin advised that we come back to the practices of Calming the Mind and Opening the Heart whenever we need to. As we continue to do that, we will see that each practice complements and enhances the other, and their unifying outcome is the awakening of wisdom and compassion. Please take your time and enjoy each stage of the exploration. Take joy in our shared intention to open our hearts, and acknowledge how fortunate we are to have the opportunity to listen to these profound teachings. Up to this point in the course, we have really been given an impression of the landscape. We have opened our eyes to the view. The entire program, Awakening Wisdom, the most profound of The Joy of Living series, is full of tasty teachings, but please remember that meditation and application, though increasingly more subtle, are critical. And the process of internalization is very personal, so I encourage you to find out how that best happens for you. The practices are only as valuable as you are really able to embody them. Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Mingyur Rinpoche's brother, says, \"My goal is for you to stop bashing into your life all the time. There is so much contact and bumping, and as we soften through the practice, we start dancing with our life, with our situation.\" Thank you for listening. I wish you well. May you see and be seen through the eyes of wisdom. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2 Multiplicity and Interdependence\" data-href=\"3.2 Multiplicity and Interdependence\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2-multiplicity-and-interdependence.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Go to Next Course →</a>","aliases":["3.1 Innate Wisdom, Conclusion - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1 innate wisdom, conclusion - Tergar joy of living course","3.1 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2-multiplicity-and-interdependence.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1-innate-wisdom-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475688,"modifiedTime":1759272587231,"sourceSize":7301,"sourcePath":"1.

But when you begin to recognize it in yourself, you change, and the quality of your life changes as well. Things you never dreamed possible begin to happen.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nWelcome, everyone. Congratulations! Now, you are in Joy of Living level three. We have this step-by-step practice: level one is awareness, level two is love and compassion, and level three is all about wisdom. It is very important to practice step by step like that. That way, we can really learn, not just intellectually, but we can get a deeper level of experience. There is homework, isn't there? I think that all of you have done the homework, and therefore you came here for level three. That is not so easy! Therefore, a warm welcome, and also, congratulations!\nNow, you are becoming more and more like senior meditators. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But, of course, actually, there is nothing to meditate on, right? If we learn more and more about there being nothing to meditate on, then we become good meditators! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I think all of you know that \"non-meditation is the best meditation.\"\nHere, in level three, of course, one of the main focuses is wisdom — why wisdom is important and also how this wisdom is with us all the time. Just like in Joy of Living level one, we learned that all have awareness 24/7, right? Now you do not just believe that, but you have gotten some experience of that already. And in the Joy of Living level two, what we talk about is that love and compassion are with us 24/7. So, now, you believe it, and you might have had some glimpse of that. Now, in level three, wisdom is with us all the time, 24/7. Actually, whatever we think, feel, and see — everything is a manifestation of wisdom, in a way.\nBut the problem is that we do not recognize that. We grasp onto the manifestation of whatever we are experiencing in our life, making our view very small, limited, and partial. If there is not impartiality, it becomes partial, divided into subject and object, divisions, and \"boxes.\" We create our own \"boxes.\" Actually, the \"boxes\" do not exist — it is just an illusion, but we do not know that. We will go through this in level three by practicing step-by-step, to see how to unbind and liberate ourselves from those boxes.&nbsp;\nTherefore, Joy of Living level three is mainly about wisdom, and wisdom is within us all the time. That is the first important practice here. And the second important practice is, while we are connecting with wisdom, we are taking everything as the path and support for that wisdom. Transformation, self-antidote, and self-liberation are also here in these teachings. So, there are two things here: the first is to connect with our true nature, basic innate goodness, fundamental nature, buddha nature, or innate enlightened quality — whatever you call it. That is the first important practice throughout all of level three. And the second important practice and way to discover our true nature is through transformation. Everything becomes a support for our practice; everything becomes an aid or support for happiness, liberation, and freedom. These two are the essence of the practices throughout level three.\nNow, why does level three come last? Maybe I will give you one simple example. Suppose that you are in the mountains, and normally you are afraid of snakes. You and your friend go hiking in a remote area of the mountain. There is no electricity, and it is totally natural, so you are camping. And around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m., the sun has gone down. There is some light, so it is not totally dark yet. Your friend has brought a rubber snake, but you do not know it is a rubber snake. And you are inside the camp, staying inside an empty room, looking at the door. And suddenly your friend comes and says, \"There is a snake here!\" after throwing in the rubber snake. You look at that rubber snake, and since you do not know it is a rubber snake, it looks like a real snake. And now your heart is jumping, \"Boom, boom, boom.\" And then your hair stands on end, you get goosebumps, and maybe you feel tightness around your neck. You cannot move your body, your muscles become very tight, and you are sweating. While you are looking at the rubber snake, you feel like the snake is now moving, and that it is ready to strike. Now, it is opening its mouth, and the poison and its tongue are coming out, and you think, \"Yeah, the snake is coming at me.\" You can no longer even look at the snake [Mingyur Rinpoche turns and covers his face with his hands], and there is a lot of suffering.\nAt that time, what do you have to do? Practice level one. You relax your body and try to be aware of the sensations in your body. Maybe you are not looking at the snake, but you are practicing. You try to be aware, and then the sensations might be too much so you change the object and listen to sounds. Then, you go back to your body. And then the fear — the audio, video, and sensations — and everything become supports for your meditation. And then you feel a little bit calmer. \"Ah, more relaxed.\" Now, you are able to look at the rubber snake — you do not have to do this [Mingyur Rinpoche covers his face with his hands]. \"Oh, yeah.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche leans forward to peer at the snake and exhales loudly.]\nThat is good, the practice from level one. \"How is the snake now? Yeah, it is still moving, still wanting to strike, but it is still okay.\" But there is still a problem because you still see the snake moving. The suffering is still there. So, then you can practice level two, love and compassion. \"Oh, dear snake, you are the same as me, wanting to be happy and not wanting to suffer. May you be happy. May you be free from suffering. May you be peaceful. May you have happiness.\" Then, the suffering lessens even more. Now, you have some sense of courage, a kind of fearlessness, but at the same time, there is a connection. \"Oh, yeah.\" Suddenly, you feel a connection with the snake. You wonder, \"How is the snake doing?\" and you want to explore more about the snake. Of course, you have to be safe, right? But now you do not see the snake as very frightening or scary anymore. Still, you are scared, of course — you have to be very careful — but it is okay to explore.\nNow, you have to practice level three. Level three is that when you really explore more about the snake, you see, \"Oh! It is just a rubber snake!\" You discover that it is not a real snake. \"Whew!\" Once you find out it is a rubber snake, the anxiety and panic go away. \"Hah!\" And you can go there and explore — it is just a rubber snake. And you can call your friend, \"Hey! There is no snake, please come.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nThat is the power of wisdom. Wisdom is really important in order to see the nature of reality. This is why we say, \"The root of suffering, the root of samsara, and the root of illusion and delusion is ignorance.\" How can we be free from this ignorance? Through wisdom. You will learn more and more about wisdom throughout this course. I am very happy that you are able to join, and, again, welcome!\nWelcome from Edwin Kelley Read\nHi, everyone. Welcome to Awakening Wisdom, the Joy of Living level three. In this program, we will have six courses that have four sections each. And so we begin with the first course, Innate Wisdom.&nbsp;\nI think the main point I want to make when beginning the Joy of Living level three, Awakening Wisdom, is that it is important to remember all of the practices that we have already engaged in from both Calming the Mind and Opening the Heart, the first two levels. I think sometimes we think, when we move on to another level of practice, that we have graduated from the earlier practice and we can let it go; now we are engaged in something new. But in actual fact it is critically important that we bring with us all of the skills and practices that we have already learned to date — particularly because it is important, in order to be able to investigate the nature of reality, to be able to have, first of all, a calm and stable mind that can stand in the face of our experience and not be disturbed or upset. We need this calm and stable mind to be able to direct our attention to our experience and examine it. And then, secondly, we need to have a heart that is open and that welcomes, embraces, and is engaged in a loving, caring manner with our experience — or, again, we will be reactive and unable to see our experience clearly.&nbsp;\nWith a stable mind and an open heart, we can now begin to investigate more clearly into the nature of our experience. And during this process, it is likely that stuff will come up. Emotions will get disturbed, we will have a lot of thoughts, doubts, etc. And so when that happens, I would like to encourage you to just go back to the practices that we already learned in Calming the Mind and Opening the Heart. And feel free to reengage with awareness, using experiences as support for awareness, or practicing loving-kindness with whatever might have caused you to react or that challenges you in some way.\nSo, please enjoy the program. I will see you in the forum. Edwin Kelley first became interested in Buddhism in 1975 when he attended a meditation retreat near Perth, Australia. In 1992 he went to Burma to undertake a six-month period of intensive retreat with the renowned meditation master Chanmyay Sayadaw.\nEdwin became a student of Mingyur Rinpoche in 1998. He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota with his wife Myoshin in 2009 to help establish the global Tergar Meditation Community. In addition to his work as an instructor, he currently serves as the co-executive director for Tergar International.\nWelcome from Kunsang Palmo Read\nHello, and welcome to the Joy of Living three program: Awakening Wisdom. My name is Kunsang Palmo, and along with Edwin, I will be guiding you through the first course, Innate Wisdom.\nEverything we have done throughout the entire Joy of Living series, all of the gentle ways of working with and relating to our mind, have led us to where we are now — to have a mind that is more supple and workable, a sense of good-heartedness, and an empathetic and tender kind of perception for ourselves and others. We have learned to access ways of being present with our ever-shifting experience and find what supports us in the here and now.\nThis program, Awakening Wisdom, is a journey of unravelling our confused assumptions about ourselves and the nature of reality. Rinpoche offers us a treasure trove of teachings and meditations to suit our diverse temperaments, in an accessible, systematic way. It takes gentle but consistent effort to see and go beyond our habitual patterning. For our experience to shift from an intellectual or understanding level into the experiential level, practice is key.\nAs you transition from daily formal practice into daily life and retain the thread of the exploration, each will complement and inform the other. When we are open and inquisitive towards what emerges, our everyday lives become the perfect ground for our practice to percolate.\nGrappling with these profound teachings that question our reality can take us to challenging and uneasy spaces. I have heard Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo say that some of the best practitioners that she has encountered are Indian housewives, because they take the essential instructions they have been given and apply them. For scholars and monastics who spend years studying and debating the texts, all that knowledge can get in the way. So I encourage you to come out of your heads and let the experience speak for itself. Let the truth of your experience be your teacher and guide.\nEnjoy the awakening of innate wisdom. Kunsang Palmo met Mingyur Rinpoche in 2006 and became his committed student in 2008. After immersing herself in the practice of meditation at Sherabling Monastery in 2014, she recognized the benefits and consequently responded to the requests of young international travelers by facilitating the Dharamsala Tergar group in North India.\nShe now lives in North India where she continues her practice and hosts the Tergar group. She hopes that her dedicated approach to her life and work, inspired by Mingyur Rinpoche's teachings, brings some benefit to others.

There are three things here. One is when you have negative emotions coming, to see at that time what your self-image is, what you are perceiving about yourself, and why you are not happy. Normally, when these strong negative emotions come, we are not happy. Suffering is always there. What are we not happy about? What is the reason?\nFor example, you might have a problem in your workplace, right? And when you are having problems at your workplace, see, \"Why am I rejecting this? Or craving that?\" Or \"What am I not happy about?\" \"Why am I disappointed?\" And you might wish to change it. What do you want to change? And for what? You can even write this down. Bring awareness to it. And the main focus here is the self.\nIn level three, the main focus is on the self. We need to discover the self. And you do not need to particularly look for that, of course, in your life. Life goes up and down, right? You know that. Life is like the waves of the ocean — going up and down. Life is like the stock market, always going up and down. In the down moments, whatever you experience about the self you can write down.\nOr when everything is going well. You have friends and family, work is going well, your relationship is going well. You have a nice self-image at that time. Write it down. What is the self-image at that time? What do you see about yourself at that moment? You can write it down. You can try to see that at the moment and bring awareness to it.\nOr you can see the self in a neutral sense — not really positive, not really negative, not particularly happy, and not particularly suffering. A more neutral moment. What do you perceive about yourself then? You can bring awareness there, look at the sense of self, and then see what you are seeing there. And you do not need to control it, you do not have to get rid of anything, you do not have to create any good image. Just see the way things are. Just see what you are perceiving as it is.\nThat is your homework practice. And bring awareness to it. The main important thing is to bring awareness. Awareness of what? The self. And what do you have to bring it to? It does not matter. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Whatever there is, just bring awareness. And if you like, you can even write it down. Normally, if you write it down, it is good from time to time. Of course, you do not have to write it down always, at your workplace, and everywhere else. It is not like that.&nbsp;\nThat is your homework.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a moment to set an intention to apply this teaching in everyday life. Choose a relationship to a person close to you — it can be a partner, parent, friend, or someone else — and become aware of the sense of self or self-image within this relationship. Spend a few days focusing on the sense of self when you are having pleasant experiences with this person. When you feel ready, you can shift your focus and explore the sense of self in neutral experiences as well as challenging ones. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to do it.Journal Reflection QuestionsWhat are you hoping to learn from this course? In which areas of your life might you apply what you learn? Are there specific relationships, work situations, or emotional and behavioral habits that you wish to focus on? Reflect on the aspirations and interests that prompted you to meditate on wisdom.Tip\nHow you view yourself does not affect who you truly are in the slightest.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom Summary\" data-href=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.1 Welcome To Innate Wisdom, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.1 welcome to innate wisdom, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.1 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Innate Wisdom: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Innate_Wisdom_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475677,"modifiedTime":1759272587251,"sourceSize":4679,"sourcePath":"1.

And our problem is that we just do not recognize this. So we have already learned and come to understand that awareness, compassion, and loving-kindness are all ways in which our true nature, our innate goodness, manifests.&nbsp;\nAnd so, here we are beginning to connect to the expression of our wisdom from within this innate goodness. And just like before, this is not something we have to create. This is not something we have to manufacture or fabricate. This is something that we are already endowed with. And the practices, all of the techniques that we learn or encounter here, are really just skillful ways for us to recognize these qualities as they manifest, to connect to the expression of our inherent true nature.&nbsp;\nAnd particularly here in level three, Awakening Wisdom, we begin to explore the ways in which, due to our misunderstanding or confusion, or what I like to call \"our erroneous perceptions,\" we begin to examine the ways in which we do not see things the way they truly are. Or what we see is not how it truly is. And we have to begin to examine this and challenge our misperceptions. We have to ask the questions that get to the bottom of how it is that we have mistakenly perceived reality to be a particular way and to examine how it truly is, so that our understanding can grow and we slowly replace our old, unhealthy way of seeing things with a new, more true, more accurate understanding of the true nature of our experience.&nbsp;\nOur journey is really just seeing all of these obstructions, these obscurations, these things that overlay and cloud our perception of how things are, and slowly realigning our understanding to be in tune with the truth of how things are.&nbsp;\nSo, enjoy the practice! <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom View\" data-href=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.1 Welcome To Innate Wisdom, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.1 welcome to innate wisdom, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.1 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Innate Wisdom (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Innate_Wisdom_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475672,"modifiedTime":1759272587257,"sourceSize":2638,"sourcePath":"1.

In fact, these things can't be found anywhere but the present moment. We just need to pause and recognize what is always right in front of us.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, we will talk about meditation on innate qualities and how we need to get familiar with these manifestations. Of course, you have not learned the details of the wisdom manifestations yet. I will guide you in a simple meditation practice on how to get familiar with our innate wisdom. Maybe you do not know what innate wisdom is on a detailed level. It is okay. No problem. Do not worry about it.\nFirst, please keep your spine loosely straight. In level three, you have the option of opening your eyes, no problem. It is up to you — you can keep your eyes open or closed. It does not matter. And when you have your eyes open, keep it natural. You do not need to control your blinking; allow yourself to blink. Relax the muscles in your body, and just be. Rest your mind in open awareness meditation. Of course, there is no need to meditate, but do not get lost.\nAs long as you are not a zombie, you are okay. If you feel like a zombie, that means you are not a zombie. The fundamental quality of your mind is clear and knowing, no matter what experience you have or what kinds of thoughts appear in your mind. The fundamental quality of your mind is always clear and knowing.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please be aware of the sense of \"me.\" We have the notion of \"me,\" all the time. \"Me, me, me.\" Feel that \"me.\" Be aware of the sense of \"me,\" or observe the sense of \"me.\" It depends on your personality. The body personality observes the \"me.\" The speech personality describes \"me.\" The mind personality feels or senses \"me.\"\nWhen you try to be with the sense of \"me,\" maybe you cannot find it. That is great! It is the same as in level one: when we look at thoughts, they disappear. In the same way, when you look at the \"me,\" \"me\" disappears. That means there is a gap, so be with the gap.\n[Silent meditation]\nOr some of you can find a sense of \"me\" — a sense of \"me\" as a feeling, or as an idea. Great! Or the sense of \"me\" has many different parts: you see your body; you may see your mind, name, role, or beliefs; you remember what other people tell you about yourself. \"I am like that because my friend told me so,\" or \"My parents told me so.\" It is also okay when you see that. Just be with that.\n[Silent meditation]\nActually, all of these are the manifestation of wisdom. Seeing yourself as arrogant, solid, not wanting to change, perfect — this is also a manifestation of wisdom. Or seeing yourself as not so stable — changing, loosening, with so many pieces — that is also wisdom.\nOr you cannot find a \"self.\" There is a gap. That is also wisdom. The important thing is that you need to look. When you look at it as it is, when you look at things as they are, whether they are positive, negative, happy, or not happy does not matter. Whatever you have or whatever you are experiencing now, just be with that. That is real wisdom. You do not have to worry about the need to fix yourself. You do not have to worry about having to be a good boy or a good girl. Just be with it as it is and observe. Be with that.\nThere is no need to get rid of anything and no need to create anything. Just be yourself.\n[Silent meditation]\nHow nice, actually. You can have all these different perspectives about yourself.\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd appreciate this variety of views, this variety of perspectives about yourself. Wonderful! These are manifestations of wisdom. Wonderful! Whatever self-image you have, whatever self-view you have, is the manifestation of wisdom.\nNow, please rest your mind in open awareness. Just be. There is no need to particularly look at the self.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. Thank you! 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n150 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture. Leave your eyes gently open for this analytical meditation.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything right now. Simply be natural.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Explore the sense of self. The key to analytical meditation is curiosity and openness. Take a minute to notice this intuitive sense of self that you carry with you every moment, every day.&nbsp;\nNotice the very fact that you are here, doing this practice. You do not need to think too much or analyze, but just notice the subtle sense of \"I am here, doing this meditation.\" You might sense this in different ways, depending on your personality. You may feel this more in the body, through thoughts and labels, or as an intuitive sense that you are doing this meditation. Whatever it is for you, simply notice however you are feeling at this moment.\nNext, explore ways that you can experience the sense of self in any given moment. Start with your body. Notice how you feel a sense of self attached to your body, right now. You do not need to think about or analyze it; just notice the sense of self in relation to your body. Explore this and see what comes up.&nbsp;\nNow, notice your sense of self in relation to the world of the senses. For example, notice it through the sounds you are hearing right now. Be aware of all these sounds and this sense that you are here, listening to these sounds. Or, you can use what you see. Notice everything appearing in your visual field, and how you are observing it. Finally, observe that there is a feeling that you are hearing sounds or looking at these visual objects.\nNow, completely let go, and rest your mind in open awareness.&nbsp;\nAgain, take a few moments to notice the sense of self — just the fact that you are here, meditating. As you do so, you might notice bodily sensations, sounds, or something else. Whatever happens is perfectly fine. Continue to examine the sense of self and how you are experiencing it in this moment.&nbsp;\nNow, examine what is happening in your mind as an expression of the sense of self. Be aware of any thoughts, memories, words, or images coming and going. Recognize that there is a sense that you are the one thinking those thoughts. Examine your mind that notices the sense of self that is accompanying your own inner experience.&nbsp;\nIf your mind gets distracted or feels more scattered than before, you do not need to worry. Just keep going with this practice, and see what you notice. End session Let go of the analytical meditation, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. What did you experience when becoming aware of the sense of \"me\"/self? Did you feel it in your body, through sensory experiences, or through thoughts, memories, images, or voices?When doing this practice of being with the sense of self, is there any difference in how you relate to who you are, compared to before? Please explain.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Inquiry\nCan I appreciate the \"sense of me\" as a manifestation of wisdom in this moment?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom Application\" data-href=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.1 Meditation","sense of self resting meditation","meditating with sense of self","if you feel like a zombie, that means you are not a zombie"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Innate Wisdom: Meditation (12 min)","level":2,"id":"Innate_Wisdom_Meditation_(12_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Innate Wisdom: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Innate_Wisdom_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475661,"modifiedTime":1759272587263,"sourceSize":8718,"sourcePath":"1.

This manifestation comes through our fundamental nature. There are many names for it; sometimes we call it \"basic innate goodness,\" or sometimes we call it \"buddha nature.\" Buddha nature is kind of a fancy word in the buddhadharma. The Buddha taught this. The last big teaching of the Buddha was about buddha nature — tathagatagarbha — meaning \"our enlightened nature.\" We also call it the \"original purity,\" meaning our true nature is always pure, from the beginning. The \"original purity,\" the \"original quality,\" our \"fundamental nature\" — there are so many different names for this.\nBasically, the traditional example for this is that if there is a light in the middle of a house, a bright light, and that light is illuminating the inside of the house, it will also show outside of the house. Even if you close the doors and windows, the light will come through the cracks of the curtains of the window, through the door, or through the chimney, where the smoke goes out. It will come out through the different doors and windows.&nbsp;\nAlthough right now we do not recognize this innate wisdom within us, the wisdom is always manifesting. It is always there within us. And I think I mentioned in level two that we all have love and compassion, right? What are love and compassion based on? On wanting to be happy and not wanting to suffer. That is also a sign of our true nature.&nbsp;\nAnd I mentioned the bird nest. When there is a nest, then the mother bird goes to different places. No matter where she goes, in the end she always wants to return to the nest. Why? Because her real home is the nest. Therefore, our real home is our true nature. And what is our true nature? It is freedom from suffering; it is freedom from illusion and delusion; it is freedom from subject and object; it is peaceful, profound, and luminous. We are wanting to go back to our home. Therefore, we want to be happy; we want to look for something meaningful. We do not want to have problems, obstacles, and suffering. Why? Because we sense, we know, that this is our true nature.&nbsp;\nSimilarly here, in level three, what we are going to discuss is how we are perceiving the world. We will discuss how ignorance manifests. Ignorance manifests with the self. There are three layers of self. Normally, I discuss the unhealthy sense of self, the healthy sense of self, and the last one, the luminous self, or what I sometimes call \"self beyond self.\" Those are the three layers.\nAnd right now, most of the time, we are stuck with the unhealthy sense of self. The unhealthy sense of self is the surface level. When we go deeper into that, we have the healthy sense of self. The healthy sense of self is good, positive, and virtuous. The unhealthy sense of self is the problem maker. It is unhealthy. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But both of these are at the relative level. We have what we sometimes call the \"fake relative\" and \"true relative\". The unhealthy sense of self is \"fake relative,\" and the healthy sense of self is \"true relative.\" Sometimes, many people misunderstand this wisdom aspect the first time they hear about these teachings. And they think, \"'No-self' means you cannot have any self.\" It is not like that. We need the healthy sense of self at the relative level. But then, what is the absolute level? The luminous self, or what we sometimes call \"self beyond self.\" This is our true nature. For that, there is what we call \"emptiness meditation.\"&nbsp;\nIn this course, we are going to discuss all of this step by step. We will have not only discussions, but we will also do practice and meditation. The way we are going to practice is through the view, meditation, and application. The view is to understand it from an intellectual level, or cognitive level. To bring this into experience is what we call \"meditation.\" We bring the view into experience with meditation. Then, applying it in everyday life is \"application.\" We will use these three together.\nNow, I would like to say a little bit about what I told you, which is that \"everything is a manifestation of wisdom.\" I think you might not believe that, right now. The first time my father told me this, I did not believe it. I thought, \"How come? I have this wrong view, do you think this wrong view is the manifestation of ignorance?\" I asked my father this, and he laughed. First, he listened to all of my confusion, and after I asked all these questions, he gave me the answers.&nbsp;\nMaybe now, I will give you just one example. One that my father told me was about a person who is born blind. If the blind person wants to understand elephants, if the teacher is not so skillful, then the blind person might try to understand or sense the elephant by touching the elephant's legs. He cannot see the elephant, but he touches the elephant's legs. If he stops there, he might think the elephant is like a tree trunk. \"Oh, an elephant is like a tree trunk.\" Or maybe some touch the elephant's belly and think the elephant is like a drum. \"An elephant is like a drum.\" Maybe they touch the elephant's tail, and the elephant seems like a snake. \"Oh, the elephant is like a snake.\" Or maybe they touch the nose, which seems like a snake, also, and they think the elephant is like a snake. Maybe they touch its ear, and it seems like the elephant is like a fan. But, in a way, all of these are pieces of the elephant. There is truth in it. The elephant's leg looks like a trunk; the elephant's stomach looks like a drum; the elephant's nose looks like a snake; the elephant's ear looks like a fan, that is true. But that is not the full picture of the elephant. It is just pieces. If we think \"The elephant is like a fan only,\" then that is a mistake — a mistaken view of the elephant. We understood the elephant the wrong way.&nbsp;\nWe need to see the full picture, and then we can see the real elephant. Similarly, I will discuss in level three that the unhealthy sense of self is also a manifestation of wisdom. And the healthy sense of self is also a manifestation of wisdom. These are both on the relative level. But the problem is that most of the time we are stuck with the unhealthy sense of self. We are stuck thinking \"the elephant is just like a fan,\" and we do not see any further. Or maybe we reach deeper, to the healthy sense of self, but we stop there. But the full picture of our true nature is the luminous self — self beyond self. With that, you understand the full picture of the elephant.\nHow can we understand the full picture of the elephant? We need to practice step-by-step.\nThank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nTo illustrate the importance of recognizing innate wisdom, Mingyur Rinpoche shares an example of a rubber snake and how to apply the practice in this type of situation. He explains that even if you practice awareness and loving-kindness and compassion with the snake, the root of suffering remains. If you were to explain to a friend why it is that we need to recognize our innate wisdom, what would you say? Question 2\nWith regards to the question above, can you come up with another example to illustrate this? Points to remember:\nYour fundamental nature is always present, no matter what you think, feel, and perceive.\nInnate wisdom allows you to see the nature of reality.\nThrough the practice of recognizing innate wisdom, you will uproot ignorance and suffering.\nInquiry\nHow am I relating to my experience of the \"sense of self\" in this particular moment?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nabout how we do not usually recognize our fundamental nature\nhow to begin to recognize your fundamental nature\nhow to cultivate joyful wisdom Joyful Wisdom, pp. 265-270 (Ch. 12: \"Joyful Wisdom\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom Meditation\" data-href=\"3.1.1 Welcome to Innate Wisdom Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.1 Welcome To Innate Wisdom, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.1 welcome to innate wisdom, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.1 View","elephant analogy"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Innate Wisdom: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Innate_Wisdom_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.1-welcome-to-innate-wisdom-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475646,"modifiedTime":1759272587277,"sourceSize":9053,"sourcePath":"1.

What did you discover? You might discover that there are expectations and that you want to match those expectations. We have some predictions about the future, and we set that as a goal. And then, we try to control things to reach that. And then, when any interruption comes — Boom! We become unhappy.\nMaybe the self sometimes feels, \"I am not good. I am a loser.\" Or sometimes, \"I know everything.\" \"I saw that, and that is not right. They are interrupting me.\" \"Actually, I know best, in a way.\" Or there is disappointment or sadness about what cannot be controlled. When things cannot be controlled, we might feel a lot of fear, anxiety, or stress. All this comes. Just try to reflect on that.&nbsp;\nActually, now, this homework is about self-created suffering and natural suffering. So we need to look, in everyday life, at what comes from these expectations — both fear and expectations. From fear, there is rejection and aversion. You do not want that experience. From expectations, craving and grasping come. We go between these two. And for both of these, the basis is ignorance — not knowing the way things are. Of course, we know something, but normally it is not clear. It is blurred, like, as I mentioned before, seeing the rubber snake as a snake.\nBased on that, a lot of self-created suffering comes. Maybe 10% is real suffering, and 90% is not real. Try to see that in your life. We are not saying there is no suffering at all. Of course, there is suffering — natural suffering. But 90% is self-created suffering.\nNow, your homework is to see how much is natural suffering and how much is self-created suffering. Of course, you cannot find the exact measurement. Normally, we have this habit: \"How many? How much? What is the average? What is the percentage precisely? 10% is natural suffering? Or 10.2% is natural suffering? Or 10.5%? Or 90% exactly? Or 89 point something?\" This is also part of self-created suffering. We can be very controlling and precise. But in reality, there are so many different causes and conditions, and all of these are related to each other. Therefore, the more you try to look at it clearly, the more uncertain and unclear you will become. That is okay. Fine. But this is more general. Try to bring that sense to this.&nbsp;\nSometimes, suddenly you will see a lot of self-created suffering in your life. It might be that in many cases, you are negative. In many cases, you are selfish, controlling, and have high expectations. That is okay. Just observe it. You can write it down. I am not saying you should say, \"I should not do that.\" or, \"I should do that.\" Here, just bring awareness, and accept it, allow it. When you bring awareness, that is wisdom. Acceptance is love and compassion. And seeing things as they are, closely, is wisdom. When you see things more clearly, eventually you will transform. The negative things automatically go away. The positive will come back, automatically.\nTry that in your life, your workplace, and your relationships. But one thing is that maybe you cannot do this with a big problem. You cannot see it because it is too much. It is okay. If you are totally caught up in that and you cannot see it with big problems and sufferings, that is totally okay. Do it with a small one first, an easy one. Okay?\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTo apply this teaching in everyday life, the practice is to see how you predict or expect a certain outcome and to notice the suffering you experience when reality does not match your expectations. So, take a moment to reflect on your upcoming day. Pick a few situations which you often bring big expectations to. Set an intention to apply the practice in those situations. In the evening, take a few minutes to reflect on whether or not you remembered to apply the practice during the day. Renew your aspiration to continue the practice tomorrow.Journal Reflection QuestionsIn what areas of your life do you have expectations that lead to added difficulties for yourself and/or others?

We each experience this in our own idiosyncratic way. Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes it is gross, but the notion of \"I\" consistently permeates our lives.\nWith a sense of open receptivity and goodwill, in this section, we will now access our discerning wisdom. We will take a step back and expand our perspective to differentiate between what is referred to as \"natural suffering\" and \"self-created suffering.\"\nLet's take an unpleasant but natural experience I am sure you all are familiar with: a headache. In Joy of Living one, you might have explored using sensations as a support for awareness. Another very natural occurrence is the experience of waiting. Not everything in the world is ready when we want it. And yet the feeling of waiting can be an ordeal of growing irritability, tension, and even intolerance.\nBecause of wisdom, we can observe the mind and body as it becomes afflicted and restless. We can see that the mind that solidifies, fixates, and ruminates is not a happy mind. We also intuitively know when something is off and that there are more healthy ways of being in the world. We could say our suffering is intelligent.\nRecognizing self-created suffering as self-created suffering, and accepting natural suffering as natural suffering, is the beginning of genuine freedom.\nAfter this video, I would like to invite you to take a few moments to recall a recent time when you were miffed about something, and then ask yourself, \"Did it need to be such a big deal?\" Did you need to suffer that much?\nWhat we are really trying to do here is learn how not to make a problem out of daily life. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.2 Natural and Self-Created Suffering View\" data-href=\"3.1.2 Natural and Self-Created Suffering View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.2-natural-and-self-created-suffering-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.2 Natural And Self-Created Suffering, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.2 natural and self-created suffering, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Natural and Self-Created Suffering (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Natural_and_Self-Created_Suffering_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.2-natural-and-self-created-suffering-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.2-natural-and-self-created-suffering-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475644,"modifiedTime":1759272587296,"sourceSize":2552,"sourcePath":"1.

Yet negativity comes from attitudes, preconceptions, and resistance, not the obstacles themselves.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nOnce we know the general idea of self-created suffering and natural suffering, then we need to bring this wisdom into our feelings, experience, and, after that, bring it into our daily life.\nAs in a story in the sutras, if someone has been shot by an arrow, that is natural suffering. You already got struck by the arrow, and now you cannot do much. Of course, you have to check with the doctor, and you have to try to heal the wound. You have to try your best. But more important is the second arrow shot in the mind, which is the self-created suffering.\nHere, the first important thing is that we need to be aware of this self-created suffering. Just to be aware of the self-created suffering is wisdom. You do not have to get rid of self-created suffering; you do not have to create any particular thing. You just have to be aware of that.\nPlease keep your spine loosely straight. You can open your eyes if you want. Relax the muscles in your body. Of course, if you cannot relax the muscles in your body, that is totally okay. Allow that you cannot relax. If there is tightness or tension in your body, you just be with that. When you allow that, that is wisdom, and that means you are accepting the suffering.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please rest your mind in open awareness. Just be, as it is.\n[Silent meditation]\nLet's try to bring attention to your body now. If you have some discomfort in your body — maybe pain, tightness, tension, or stress — then it may be related with an emotion, like anxiety or depression. With whatever emotion you have, you might have a bodily sensation. Bring awareness to that.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, see the emotion behind the emotion, the feeling behind the feeling. You may have an expectation about this pain. \"I should not have pain,\" or, \"I need this pain to go away.\" \"I have to have perfect health.\" \"This is an obstacle.\" See how the list of expectations is there with pain. When you see these expectations, allow them. Do not try to get rid of these expectations. Allow them, and be with these expectations. When you allow these expectations, that is actually kindness. You are kind to yourself. That is compassion, that is love. Everybody makes mistakes. That is okay. Allow the mistakes, and just be aware of them.\nOf course, when you see these expectations, aversions, cravings, fear of pain, or resistance to pain, these are the causes of self-created suffering. But when you allow and accept them, then the pain is actually not so scary. But still, there will be pain. That is okay.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, you can think about a relationship in your life. Maybe you have a good relationship, and you might have a list of strong expectations for that relationship. Maybe your relationship is not so good, and you have a lot of aversion, resistance, and fear. And you have a lot of ideas about the relationship — general beliefs about the way the relationship should be. Look at those. Maybe your relationship is not good now, and you might have a lot of regrets.\n[Silent meditation]\nWhatever is there, you just need to be aware of it. You do not need to say, \"I should not have this expectation. I should not have this aversion, or craving.\" Just allow it and be with it. Seeing this aversion and craving is wisdom. Allowing aversion and craving is love and compassion.\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd you can look at your life in general, at your workplace or even in your spiritual life. We all have this self-created suffering, from not knowing, from not being aware of the way things are. Then, secondly, we have aversion and craving.\nHere, the wisdom is to just be with it and see things as they are. How nice! Normally, when we hear a lot of spiritual guidelines, they say, \"You have to block the negative and create the positive.\" But here, just being with and seeing these negative emotions as they are, positive emotions as they are, aversion as it is, and craving as it is is wisdom. And that is love and compassion, that is awareness. Seeing things as they are is awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom. It is forgiveness. That wisdom will lead you to fully recognize who you are.\nOkay, now rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation] 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n180 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease and relaxation.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest in this natural, knowing quality.&nbsp; Main practice Be aware of your body. See where there is discomfort, uneasiness, tightness, or painful sensations. Bring the light of awareness into these sensations.\nNow, reflect on any reactivity or expectation that might be present with respect to these sensations. Perhaps there are beliefs, stories, fear, anxiety, or something else overlaying these bare sensations.&nbsp;\nSimply be aware of the reactions and expectations; allow them to be held within awareness.&nbsp;\nNext, be aware of any pleasant sensations in the body. Simply let them be as they are.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind a recent situation that might have been somewhat strong. Remember the first impact on your body.&nbsp;\nThen, remember what happened in your mind. Perhaps you had reactions, expectations, ideas, beliefs, thoughts, or emotions.&nbsp;\nFor a few moments, simply be aware of them as they are. Seeing self-created suffering with awareness is wisdom. End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. What was your experience like when you saw the expectations, hopes, and/or fears behind your experience? How does seeing these inform you about the way you experience challenging situations?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice.

Normally, there is what we call \"natural suffering\" and \"self-created suffering.\" Self-created suffering actually does not really exist. It does not exist on the relative level — not on the true relative level, or the healthy relative level. And, of course, at the absolute level, nothing exists; everything is emptiness. As I mentioned before, there is the unhealthy sense of self, the healthy sense of self, and the luminous self. Self-created suffering is connected with the unhealthy sense of self. And that is totally delusion and illusion, even on the relative level.\nBut then, what does exist on the relative level is natural suffering. What are the differences between self-created suffering and natural suffering? For example, if you have a sickness, then in general you have problems with your physical body. That is natural.\nWe have what we normally call the \"four rivers of suffering.\" One is being born. When you are being born, there is a lot of suffering. Then, there is getting old. When we get older, there is a lot of suffering. Then, there is sickness. Sickness is also natural suffering. And dying is also natural suffering. You cannot really control it. It is the true relative level; it exists on the relative level. So, what do you have to do? You have to accept it.\nBut then, there is the fear of death and dying, fear of or aversion to sickness, or fear of getting old. There is a lot of craving, not wanting whatever you have, or looking for some perfect image of yourself or an unreasonable image of yourself. You want to have youth forever. You do not want to get old. Or you want a perfectly healthy body and to never get sick.\nThese create a lot of extra problems. Of course, I am not saying that you should not keep young; of course, for the relative level, we should do physical exercise and be aware of our diet. And we have to follow a rhythm of good sleep and balance in our life. You can try your best to keep your body healthy and mind happy. All of this is no problem.\nThe problem is when we have a lot of that in our mind and we are creating a lot of things in our mind, and we do not see whatever positive things we have. Normally, we say that if there are ten qualities within us, and nine of them are positive and one is negative, we only look at the negative one and exaggerate it. And we do not see the nine good qualities within us.\nMaybe I should tell you a short story. One time, I was at the monastery where we have a stupa. And around the stupa, there are a lot of small stones stuck in the ground. But they are not completely even, and some stones come up here and there. And normally, if we go around the stupa, we have to take off our shoes, so we have to walk barefoot. So for me, it was very uncomfortable because the stones hurt my feet. And I always really wanted to go around the stupa, but when I thought about the stupa I thought about those rocks, and I felt a lot of resistance. So when I walked, each step was suffering, like \"I appreciate this wonderful stupa. Oh, pain!\" I would feel a lot of suffering. Then one time, I went to the West for a full checkup. The doctor said, \"Your health is good, but you have to do more physical exercise.\" And one of the exercises was to walk on pieces of rock barefoot. That is more like an Asian doctor's advice. And the doctor said that around the feet there are so many different points that are good for the organs and the entire body. He told me all the details, and I was really surprised that walking barefoot on stones is so good for health. Then, I finished my tour and went back to my monastery, and I tried to circle around the stupa. Then I remembered, \"Oh! There are rocks here!\" And I was quite happy. I had been thinking, \"Where could I find those stones?\" But actually, they were right there. Then, I walked barefoot on the stones. I felt very good. \"I am doing exercise, and each step feels very nice and happy.\" But the pain was still there. So, the pain with the feet is natural suffering. A few months before, that pain had become very uncomfortable for me. That is self-created suffering. But later, the pain became a cause of happiness. So knowing how the mind creates suffering is really important. And that is not only with those pieces of stone but with everything in our life. It is connected with our relationships. The more expectations we have, the more sensitive our mind becomes. Then we will see all these negative aspects.\nNormally, people come to me and ask me to pray for them, and they say, \"I want to find my soulmate.\" Mr. or Mrs. Perfect. And they have a long list. Please bless me to find a partner who is a meditator in the same lineage. And someone who is there for me and understands me. A long list. And I tell them, \"Okay, I can pray, but, well, there is no such thing as Mr. or Mrs. Perfect. You might find Mr. or Mrs. Okay. That is okay! Accept it.\" And they say, \"Please pray.\" And sometimes they come and say, \"I found them!\" When I hear \"I found them,\" I think \"uh oh\" in my mind. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] \"That is a big problem.\" Then you have these big expectations, and the mind becomes so tight. Then what happens? The relationship normally does not last very long.\nMaybe I will tell you a story about a car. Let's say, if you like a car, maybe your favorite car — a BMW, a Mercedes, or nowadays we have Tesla, right? Many people like Tesla. You really want to have that car, and you are saving money to buy it. And one day you go into town, and you see your dream car. And you are so happy. \"Wow!\" While you are looking at the car, suddenly a truck comes and crashes into the car. So, what happens? Of course, you feel sorry about it, but you might take photos, you know? Of course, you feel sad, but, at the same time, excited. \"Now my dream car is broken!\" And you can put the photo of it on Facebook or Instagram or whatever. Then, a few weeks later, you might think, \"My savings may not be enough to buy my dream car. So I will go for a second-hand car. That is easier.\" So one day you decide to buy a second-hand car and go into town to the second-hand car shop. There, you see a car — your dream car, second-hand — and you really like it and you want to buy it. But, actually, that car is the same as the one that, a few weeks ago, had the accident that you saw. But you do not know that it is the same car. Then, you buy the car and sign for it, maybe around 3 p.m., and make a down payment. \"Now, the car belongs to me. It is my car.\" Right after 3 p.m., it becomes your car.\nThen it depends on you whether you have strong grasping or not. I will mention more about grasping later. Normally, we have three concepts that we call \"singularity,\" \"permanence,\" and \"independence.\" If you do not know the details of these now, do not worry. We have these three combined together with the car. The tighter your mind is about your car, the more expectations you have, the more suffering you will have. While you are driving your car, maybe the road is not so good, and it might have bumps. If the road is bumpy, with each bump, your heart jumps. Your hair stands on end, and you get goosebumps. Then maybe you drive into the countryside and the road is not so good. And then the wheel spits a piece of stone upward, and that stone comes down and hits your windshield. \"Tak!\" The moment you hear the \"tak!\" what happens? It seems like a knife cutting through your heart. You almost have a heart attack. But, actually, the car is the same. Three weeks before, that car had an accident with another car, and you did not have this knife-cutting-through-your-heart experience, you know? You might have felt sorry. But even if the car was totally smashed, you would not have had big suffering. But now, after 3 p.m., when just one stone hits the windshield, it is almost like you are going to have a heart attack. Why? Because of the grasping.\nThen, if you continue with that car, then what will happen after a few weeks is that you might think, \"Oh, this car is not what I expected.\" You will see a lot of problems. \"Oh, the gearshift is no good. The shape is not good. And this kind of feature is not good. And that kind of feature is not good.\" Then you cannot really appreciate the car. You see all of its problems. Of course, there is always some problem, but now the entire car is a problem. You cannot enjoy the car.\nThat is a small example of how our mind creates suffering. In English, there is a phrase for this: \"We make a mountain out of a molehill.\" It is a small bump, but we make it a mountain.\nLet's do a simple exercise. Try this. Hold your hand here [Mingyur Rinpoche holds out his fist in front of him, with his thumb extended], and close one eye [Mingyur Rinpoche covers one eye with his other hand]. You see the thumb, right? Now bring your thumb close to your eye. [Mingyur Rinpoche draws back his thumb until it is directly in front of his eye.] Closer, closer, closer . . . What do you see now? Your thumb. Now, look to the right [Mingyur Rinpoche turns his head, keeping his thumb in front of his eye], and you see the thumb. Now, look at the left, and you see the thumb. Look up, and you will also see the thumb. Look down, and you will see the thumb. Now, bring it out far away from your eyes. Farther, farther . . . Now, what you see is the thumb and many things around it.\nHere, it is the same thing. With our grasping mind, when it is too tight with a singular, independent, and permanent view, we slowly make small problems into very big problems. And we do not see big problems. If you have a big problem in your life, you will not see it. Instead, you see everything as being the fault of that small problem.\nTherefore, we know how our mind makes a prison. Actually, we put ourselves into our own prisons. And who creates this prison or jail? We create it. Therefore we can free or liberate ourselves from it. All of these teachings in level three are about how we can liberate ourselves from our own prison.&nbsp;\nThank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche shared a story about how he felt unhappy with the pain in his feet when walking barefoot over stones. However, after his doctor advised him to apply more pressure to his feet, he felt happy with the discomfort of walking barefoot. Can you think of similar examples in which this is true in your own life?\nPoints to remember:\nThe two types of suffering are natural and self-created suffering.\nSeeing how your mind creates suffering is the key to wisdom.\nSelf-created suffering is part of the unhealthy sense of self.\nWhen your mind is grasping, you experience small problems as big problems.\nTip\nCultivate a sense of curiosity, and set an intention to see how your mind relates to your possessions, work, family, community, etc. Let self-created suffering become a reminder for recognizing awareness.\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nthe definitions of natural and self-created suffering\nhow we often put ourselves into a self-created prison\nhow to gain insight into the way our conditional perceptions and beliefs influence how we interpret our experience Joyful Wisdom, pp. 43–49 (Ch. 2: Start at \"Two Views of Suffering\" and end before \"The Suffering of Suffering\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.2 Natural and Self-Created Suffering Meditation\" data-href=\"3.1.2 Natural and Self-Created Suffering Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.2-natural-and-self-created-suffering-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.2 Natural And Self-Created Suffering, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.2 natural and self-created suffering, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Two Kinds of Suffering: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Two_Kinds_of_Suffering_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (9 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(9_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.2-natural-and-self-created-suffering-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.2-natural-and-self-created-suffering-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475630,"modifiedTime":1759272587314,"sourceSize":12597,"sourcePath":"1.

In everyday life, sometimes you have to think about your future plans. Or, at your office, you have to think about your work. \"What should I do tomorrow?\" Or you make to-do lists, right? \"What do I need to do tomorrow or next month or later today?\" When you do that, do it mindfully. What do you have to do first? You have to rest your mind in open awareness a little bit, and just be. When you \"just be\" like that, you automatically connect with awareness. Then try to think about the to-do list. \"After I have done this video recording [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs], where will I go? Now, I grow corn in my garden, in front of my house. So I am going to pick this organic, fresh corn, and maybe I will fry it. Yes. That is one thing. And second, maybe I will do some exercise.\" And when you do that mindfully, when you think like that, you might feel tired. Then rest again for a few seconds. See how long according to your time. Maybe for one minute or a few seconds, just be. Then you can think again. When you do that, actually it is really good for your life and your planning. Your imagination will develop, and your thinking will become clearer. Normally, we think and get lost in thoughts. We think and think, too much, and then we cannot think very clearly. So we have to rest and drop. We just drop and that helps our thinking capacity. We can think, and then we can stop — \"stop\" means \"resting.\" And then think again. That is good for your life, in whatever you do. And in meditation, we do the same thing. For analytical meditation, we have to analyze with awareness or mindfulness, but then we have to rest in open awareness. Therefore, in the beginning, I always ask you to rest in open awareness, then we do whatever analytical meditation, and then rest in open awareness again. This is very important. Try to practice this in your life.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the beginning of your day, set a clear intention to examine how you are responding to sensory input, such as tastes or smells of foods during a meal, sounds of a neighbor's dog barking, or physical pain. Bring to mind three specific situations in which you intend to practice by taking a moment to step back and ask yourself, \"How am I reacting to what is happening right now?\" Once you feel comfortable with the world of the senses, you can move on to exploring your reactions to particular thoughts and emotions.Journal Reflection Questions\nMingyur Rinpoche invites you to apply this practice to your thinking in daily life, and to do it mindfully. As you engage in this practice of thinking intentionally about a future plan, does your experience change in any way?&nbsp;\nOne of the important points is to not judge yourself but to be curious about your reactions in life. In what types of situations do you find yourself resisting or holding onto something? As you investigate with awareness and intention, do you experience any changes in these situations? Please explain.\nTip\nIf you are seeing things as they are, you are already connected with awareness, compassion, and wisdom.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.3 Analytical Meditation Summary\" data-href=\"3.1.3 Analytical Meditation Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.3 Analytical Meditation, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.3 analytical meditation, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.3 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Analytical Meditation: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Analytical_Meditation_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475614,"modifiedTime":1759272587328,"sourceSize":4333,"sourcePath":"1.

And we are taken through a series of inquiries that are very carefully considered and that come to us from hundreds of years of practice from within this lineage.\nWith the idea that it is important to understand why we go about examining things in this way, think about, for instance, if you had lost or misplaced your set of keys. You could choose to just randomly walk around anywhere looking for your keys, wondering to yourself, \"Where are my keys? Where did I leave my keys? I am stupid. I lost my keys.\" But if you take a little time at the beginning, before you start looking, to recall when you used them last or where you might have been in the last little while since you last used your keys, you might think, \"Oh, I was doing such and such around this place. Maybe I should go there to look for my keys.\" Or, \"Oh, I remember. I was walking up the stairs and had so many things in my arms. I might have dropped them on the staircase.\" Or something like that. This is the way we use our understanding, our intellect, to examine our experience, just like we would to help us find our set of keys. So we eliminate a long arduous task of looking in a lot of places where we will not find our keys. This is why analytical meditation is important.\nThe way this analytical meditation works, we are building on the skills and practices that we have developed in both Joy of Living level one and Joy of Living level two. With a calm and stable mind, together with an open and appreciative heart, we now direct our mind to examine our experience, to investigate, to inquire what is truly going on. And with these qualities of mind directed at our experience, we begin to see that things are not necessarily the way we thought they were. The delusion, the confusion, the misperceptions, are exposed, and wisdom reveals itself from within our experience. The true nature of our experience is revealed. And this is why it is called \"insight meditation.\"\nSo, follow Mingyur Rinpoche's instructions closely, and hopefully you will begin to see the true nature of your experience. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.3 Analytical Meditation View\" data-href=\"3.1.3 Analytical Meditation View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.3 Analytical Meditation, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.3 analytical meditation, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Analytical Meditation (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Analytical_Meditation_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475600,"modifiedTime":1759272587335,"sourceSize":2943,"sourcePath":"1.

Either way, you're still experiencing the unlimited nature of your true being.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nFor analytical meditation, we need to analyze, so we have to give a job to our mind. Normally, we are thinking, and a lot of thoughts come automatically. And even if we are thinking about plans for the future, we do not have a bigger sense of awareness. We are lost in those thoughts and emotions. Here, we need to think with awareness. When we think with awareness, then it becomes meditation, analytical meditation. We are not just analyzing, but we are practicing analytical meditation.This meditation will be the preparation for analytical meditation. We are going to make a pizza. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Of course, not physically, but in our minds. I think we are going to make an organic vegetable pizza, okay? A very healthy pizza. And when you make this pizza, you have to think on purpose. You have to think consciously, with awareness. That awareness becomes meditation, and then you are thinking, so that becomes the preparation for analytical meditation. Now, please keep your meditation posture. And rest your mind in open awareness. Just let your mind be as it is. [Silent meditation] Your mind is always clear and knows. [Silent meditation] Now, we are going to imagine that we are going to make a pizza. Imagine or think that you are in the kitchen now. When you are thinking you are in the kitchen, there is awareness, so you are not lost. Do not worry. First, you start the fire. The oven is becoming very hot now. And now, you look for the pizza ingredients. You are putting all these ingredients together. I do not know how to make pizza, so do not think about all the details, okay? Now, you have made a square pizza already. And now, the fire has become stronger, and you are going to put the pizza in the oven. Mmm! Nice smell! Ah, it is almost ready. Now, you take the pizza out. It is very hot, and you put it on the table. Now, you are cutting the pizza. Mmm, there is a nice smell! And now you are going to eat the pizza. Mmm! It tastes good! [Silent meditation] Okay, now please rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay. How was it? Later, we will have a lot of analytical meditations. The style is the same. Now, instead of pizza, you can think about seeing the difference between self-created suffering and natural suffering. And you can try to see the unhealthy sense of self. And below the unhealthy sense of self, there is a healthy sense of self. Try to see deeper and deeper. And then, below that, there is the luminous self or self beyond self. You can go deeper to analyze and be with whatever comes. This is how we will discover our true nature, who we are. And you will not only discover this with yourself. When you look out, all phenomena are also like that. You will see the real nature of all phenomena. Thank you! 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture.&nbsp;\nCheck in with yourself. Take a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply be.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice First, observe sensations in your body from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet.\nNext, shift from observing to examining. First, ask a simple question, such as, \"Where do I experience resistance?\" or \"To what am I experiencing attraction right now?\" Examine how you react to sensations that are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral in your body.&nbsp;\nContinue to examine your experience in your surroundings. Simply ask questions like, \"How do I react to these sensations or sounds? Do I resist them or do I find them pleasant?\" Step back, observe, and examine how your mind responds to these experiences.\nDrop the examination, and simply rest in open, effortless awareness.\nNow, observe what is happening in your mind. Do you have any thoughts, words, or images moving through your mind? Or is your mind calm? Either way, there is no need to change anything. Simply observe.\nNext, shift from observing to examining by asking the question, \"How do I react to what is happening in my mind? Do I prefer some states of mind and resist others?\" Simply step back and examine without altering your experiences.\nNow, observe and examine your emotional state. You might be experiencing something more obvious such as boredom, restlessness, or inspiration. Or something subtle such as simply liking or not liking. Notice all the different ways that you react to what is happening.&nbsp;\nPeriodically, drop the examination, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nNow, spend some time exploring the second type of analytical meditation by contemplating a question. Here, you are thinking with intention and awareness. First, do a simple exercise of counting up to ten while observing thoughts.&nbsp;\nContinue to observe your thoughts and contemplate on purpose. Bring to mind a situation that happened over the past few days, and contemplate this question, \"What do I resist in my experience?\" Examine how you react to the situation in your life.&nbsp; End session Let go of the analytical meditation, and simply rest in open awareness. Give your mind and body true rest, and simply be here as you are in this very moment.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. How do you experience thinking in analytical meditation as opposed to being absorbed in thoughts?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Tip\nIf you are wondering, \"Am I thinking with awareness or not?\" you are already in meditation.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.3 Analytical Meditation Application\" data-href=\"3.1.3 Analytical Meditation Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.3 Analytical Meditation, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.3 analytical meditation, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.3 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Analytical Meditation: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Analytical_Meditation_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.3-analytical-meditation-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475600,"modifiedTime":1759272587340,"sourceSize":7270,"sourcePath":"1.

Maybe you are very smart, a genius of thinking and discovering — but in these ways, it is very difficult to see. Or maybe if you just meditate watching your breath — \"breathing, breathing\" — and you only do that meditation, like The Joy of Living level one style of practice, you also cannot see it completely. How can we see it? We need to have \"two wings.\" One wing is to try to explore the nature of reality, to see things as they are, and to examine what their essence is. You have to analyze at the beginning. Analytical meditation is really important to penetrate the nature of reality. But that analysis needs the help of being — \"being\" meaning awareness. It needs the help of the level one practice, the awareness practice, which is the other wing. If we have these two wings together and try to discover ourselves and the nature of reality, then we can do it. Therefore, now in level three, we need to focus on the aspect of analytical meditation. But for analytical meditation, first, you have to learn how to \"be\" without analyzing. In level one, we just listen to sounds; we do not need to ask where the sounds come from, what the essence of the sounds is, if the sounds are impermanent or not, or if the sounds are projections of our own mind or not. We do not ask these questions, right? We just \"be.\" Here, in level three, we have to ask questions. In order to do that, normally we have to have three things: listening, contemplating, and meditating. First, we have to listen, meaning that we have to learn. We have to learn about impermanence, multiplicity, pieces, interdependence, how our mind works, self-created suffering, and natural suffering. We have to learn about the nature of reality. And in the nature of reality, there is a fake reality, and there is the true reality. The fake reality is what we call the \"fake relative level.\" And the true reality is the \"true relative level.\" For example, self-created suffering is fake reality. But natural suffering is the true reality. Then there is our real nature, which is the ultimate reality. We need to see or examine this step by step. But first, we have to learn. Sometimes we say \"listening,\" sometimes \"learning,\" but they have the same meaning. After that, you have to think about the meaning of all of these together and put it into your mind with your own style and make it your own. When you learn, there are a lot of words, images, sensations, pieces, and different ideas. And all these different ideas now have to be linked together. You put all of these together. And you need to have the main idea of what impermanence is, let's say, or what the unhealthy sense of self, healthy sense of self, and the luminous self are. You need a general overview, almost like a general sense of the meaning. That is the contemplation, and that has to become yours. Then, after that, we have to meditate. We meditate with the meaning, with awareness, and with love and compassion. Analytical meditation is important. Actually, the Buddha taught about analytical meditation in ancient India. There is a great school called the \"Nalanda tradition,\" and they do this analytical meditation. In the morning, they study and learn, which is the \"hearing.\" Then, in the afternoon or early evening, they do contemplation. And sometimes in the late evening, or in the morning, they meditate. They bring learning, contemplation, and meditation together. Now, here, in level three, some of the meditations are \"just being,\" and for many of these meditations, you have to think. You have to think with awareness. When I say \"think with awareness,\" I mean consciously thinking, on purpose. Normally, what happens is that we are thinking, but our thinking comes automatically; monkey mind is giving us a job. We are not giving a job to monkey mind, are we? Therefore, monkey mind is the boss. But now, we are giving a job to monkey mind. We ask monkey mind to think. In level one, we ask monkey mind to \"just be,\" right? To be with sounds and sensations. Here, we ask monkey mind to think. And here, \"thinking\" means exploring the nature of reality. We explore the nature of reality with awareness, through consciously thinking, so level one is also here. We are not lost, actually. You can follow your thoughts, but you can follow them with awareness. In level one, when thoughts come, we \"just be.\" We are not totally thinking, right? We \"just be.\" If thoughts come one after another, we just \"be\" with that; we are not particularly thinking. And normally we say, \"Do not look for thoughts, do not create thoughts, and do not stop thoughts.\" But here, in level three, you can create thoughts. But you are not creating just any thoughts. If you create anger, it is a problem. If you create desire, it is a problem. We are not saying that. What we are saying is to create thoughts with wisdom, meaning to explore the way they are, to see the way they are. That perspective when creating thoughts is totally fine and safe. You are seeing things as they are. Sometimes, in the beginning, when we do this practice we feel a little bit uneasy, and it is easy to get lost. Because maybe you have some habit of being with everything as it is, but you might not have the habit of thinking or analyzing. So, in the beginning, we get lost, we think about impermanence, and we get lost again. \"Impermanent, impermanent . . . Why is it impermanent? What is the cause? What is the result?\" And you get lost again. That is possible. You might think, \"What is self-created suffering? What is natural suffering? Am I creating more self-created suffering?\" And you get lost again. Although you are thinking, you are not trying to control the situation here. You are just seeing things as they are. This is why the level one practice is also here. Also, when you try to see things as they are, actually you are accepting them. There is a sense of kindness, compassion, and forgiveness. Love and compassion are also there because you see things as they are. You are not trying to get rid of them, so there is no aversion, right? If aversion comes automatically, accept aversion also. Seeing aversion as aversion is also accepting it. That is also seeing things as they are. That becomes love and compassion, also. Actually, when we are in level three, level one and two are always there. They come together.

This is really easy. You do not have to control anything, you do not have to suppress anything, and you do not need to make yourself better, actually. You just recognize whatever is there, as it is. In level one, when we watch thoughts, positive thoughts are okay, negative thoughts are okay, neutral thoughts are okay, and even anger is okay. Here, it is the same — especially when you have a trigger, like when anger suddenly comes. In a situation with hatred, self-hatred comes. Sometimes we feel depressed. When we feel depressed, the self is also depressed. Or sometimes we feel low self-esteem. All of these triggers actually help us to remember awareness. Be with that. Eventually, this becomes a really powerful practice and the secret of the mind and how to work with ourselves. We have an example: if there is a forest fire, all these things that can burn will be burned by the fire — the grass, trees, branches, dead trees, etc. — but the stones and rocks cannot be burned by fire. The awareness is like fire. The wisdom of awareness. Eventually, it will burn all the unhealthy stuff. It will transform it, without you doing anything. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Nice, isn't it? Try to apply this in your life. Maybe I will tell you that you might have five different experiences. Maybe when you look, you cannot really find anything, other than a lot of images and pieces. Maybe you can look at the self from different perspectives. Or maybe it is changing and changing — the angry self is different than the depressed self. The panicked self is different than the happy or joyful self. Or you cannot find anything — there is a gap. The last one is that the unhealthy sense of self becomes stronger. If it is too strong, you can do the same thing as in Joy of Living level one: try something different, step back, take a break . . . Remember these four options, and apply these in your everyday life. Practice this short times, many times, everywhere, at any time.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a moment to reflect on what situation you would like to apply this practice to in daily life. Think of when the situation might occur ahead of time and set an intention to apply the practice. In this instance, the practice is to simply be with the sense of self in the situation. The intention is to gain insight about who you truly are, just the way you practiced in Joy of Living level one. When a strong emotion gets triggered, use it as support and rest with the sense of self. You do not need to analyze it or ask questions. Remember, if the practice is overwhelming, you can apply one of the remaining three steps of practice: try something different, step back, or take a break.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhat happens when you apply awareness while engaging in a situation in daily life?

As a \"spacious mind personality,\" even though I am naturally more inclined towards resting meditation, analytical meditation brings clarity and sharpness to my practice I had not encountered before doing these contemplations. I would encourage you to continue to experiment with practices you would not normally be drawn towards and see how the mind responds. In the next section, Rinpoche will introduce us to what he calls the \"unhealthy sense of self\" and the \"healthy sense of self.\" Our invitation is to explore what this means with an open heart, to be both observant and honest. Rinpoche again reaffirms the profound insight that we do not need to get rid of or change any part of who we are. Otherwise, our meditation path is all about self-improvement. But we do not want to hear this teaching and take it as gospel, either. Rather we need to trust the wisdom that emerges from our own experience. There is a quote I love by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche that speaks to this. He says, \"Becoming awake involves seeing our confusion more clearly.\" As we start to contemplate the unhealthy and healthy sense of self, what we might notice is a seamless transition from unhealthy to healthy, as fluid as lapping waves. We do not need to scrub away at the unhealthy sense of self or try to unpack it. We do not need to search for the healthy sense of self like it is a light at the end of the tunnel. In daily life, both are operative. Imagine you go home as an adult and your family treats you like you are still a teenager. And you are irked because you are not that adolescent anymore. But for a parent, perhaps you will always be their child, and for someone else, you are the parent, the teacher, the student, and so on. In reality, you are what anyone makes of you because you are not one-dimensional. You are not a fixed, independent entity. The invitation here is to see and be present with what Rinpoche calls \"fake relative\" and \"true relative,\" and let the experience be your teacher. Everything is welcome. Nothing needs to be left out. It is all for learning. In fact, as the unhealthy and healthy sense continue to operate off the cushion, this might be where your greatest insights come — when you are more natural and just living life. You might start to see how, when you are not in sync with reality, you experience unnecessary tension. And if you could remain anchored and open, what is revealed is our shared human vulnerability. When we can stay in relationship with all aspects of life — happiness and joy, as well as pain and suffering — everything can be a vehicle to connect with wisdom and compassion. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.4 the Sense of Self View\" data-href=\"3.1.4 the Sense of Self View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.4-the-sense-of-self-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.4 The Sense Of Self, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.4 the sense of self, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing the Sense of Self (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_the_Sense_of_Self_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.4-the-sense-of-self-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.4-the-sense-of-self-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475594,"modifiedTime":1759272587375,"sourceSize":3464,"sourcePath":"1.

Level one is mainly about awareness. With awareness meditation in level one, we never analyze, and we never ask any particular question. We just be with whatever comes. We are aware of whatever comes. In level one, we meditate with forms, sounds, smells, tastes, sensations, thoughts, and emotions. And then you do not need to ask questions. You do not ask yourself if the sound is impermanent or not, if it is single or multiple, or where it comes from. It is not necessary, is it? Whatever is there, you just be with that. That is resting meditation. And we already started analytical meditation in level two. We tried to give a job to our mind, to develop love and compassion, to recognize love and compassion. That is analytical meditation. And here, in level three, we already did some analytical meditation. We tried to look, in particular, at the sense of self and whether there is a healthy or unhealthy sense of self, and we asked some questions. We did that before, and we will do more analytical meditation here in level three. And actually, I introduced analytical meditation with making pizza, remember? That is analytical meditation. Today, here, is resting meditation. For resting meditation here, we just look at the sense of self. Or the feeling of self. And this is more about the feeling, not too much about the analytical or conceptual aspect. But we all have the sense of \"me, me me,\" or the feeling. The moment we wake up in the morning, there is some kind of \"me.\" Sometimes that feeling of me is strong and sometimes less strong. And of course, the concept is there, the feeling is there. And there is some kind of belief. At a subtle level, there is a habit of perceiving \"me.\" These three come together, actually: the idea about \"me;\" the feeling, sense, or notion of \"me;\" and, on an unconscious or a subconscious level, a sense of \"me.\" These three are together. Sometimes they are stronger, sometimes less so. Now, we will watch that, or feel that, or focus on that. Remember, there are three personalities. You can observe, focus on, or sense or feel it — whatever you feel comfortable with. Just be with that sense of \"me.\" And that sense of \"me,\" is very strong. Okay. Now, please, keep your spine loosely straight. Please relax the muscles in your body. And first, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, please be with the sense of \"me.\" Maybe it is around your heart, or around your head. Or maybe throughout the whole body. You do not need to ask questions, like, \"Who am I?\" or, \"Where am I?\" It is not necessary. Just look at the sense of \"me.\" Be with the feeling of \"me.\" And maybe that is more related with the unhealthy sense of self. That is totally okay. Or maybe to the healthy one. That is also okay. You do not need to change from the unhealthy to the healthy one. Just bringing awareness to it, just observing it, is the beginning of the healthy self. Just being with the unhealthy or healthy sense of self, whatever comes to your mind, is wisdom. [Silent meditation] And maybe you cannot find it. You cannot grab the sense of self. Great! If you cannot grab the sense of self, that is the \"gap.\" That is what I call \"horizontal liberation.\" Be with that, be with the gap. Or be with the unhealthy or healthy sense of self — whatever comes to your mind. Great, that is wisdom! And that is \"vertical liberation.\" And even when you allow the unhealthy sense of self, that is real forgiveness, being kind to yourself, acceptance. That is love and compassion also. Allow whatever is there. Let it come. Do not try to make it bigger. Do not try to control it. Do not try to get lost. [Silent meditation] And awareness is bigger than the unhealthy and healthy sense of self. Innate love and compassion are bigger than the unhealthy and healthy sense of self. And both of these, the unhealthy and healthy sense of self, are like clouds in the sky. Okay. Now, rest your mind in open awareness again. Okay. This is resting meditation, or not analyzing. This is what we call the \"direct experience\" style of looking at the self. Thank you! 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session Take a moment to appreciate this opportunity to practice.&nbsp;\nBegin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness — this sense of openness, ease, and presence. Main practice As you rest in open awareness, notice if there is a sense of self or of a \"me.\" Is it connected to the body? Does it arise with a story or label? Or, do you have a felt sense of self? Simply be aware of the sense of self within awareness.&nbsp;\nContinue to rest, and notice how you experience a sense of self. At times, the sense of self might be healthy, fluid, changing, and have many different parts that are interdependent. At other times, it might feel solid, independent, and as if it wants to hold onto or control experience. Whatever you find, simply allow them to come and go freely within awareness.&nbsp;\nIf there is a gap, just know it's there. If you can see and feel the sense of self, allow it to be there. The full play of the sense of self is reflected within awareness.\nIf your mind gets lost and caught up in thinking, when you recognize that, just rest for a moment in awareness. Then, look again at this sense of self, and just let it be. End session Rest in open awareness. Simply be aware and undistracted.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. How do you \"be\" with the sense of \"me\" in resting meditation?Is it challenging not to ask any questions but rather directly experience the sense of self? Please explain why or why not.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Tip\nIn nonjudgmental awareness, you are allowed to judge.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.1.4 the Sense of Self Application\" data-href=\"3.1.4 the Sense of Self Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.4-the-sense-of-self-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.1.4 The Sense Of Self, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.1.4 the sense of self, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.1.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Sense of Self: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_Sense_of_Self_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.4-the-sense-of-self-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.1/3.1.4-the-sense-of-self-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475589,"modifiedTime":1759272587382,"sourceSize":7532,"sourcePath":"1.

The opportunity to experience yourself differently is always available.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nways to explore who you are and the nature of reality\nthe three ways we experience a sense of self\nyour fundamental nature\nWatch Read\nNow, we are going to look, step by step, at deeper levels of ourselves. Normally, there are three senses of self. First, there is the unhealthy sense of self, then the healthy sense of self, and then the luminous self, or what we sometimes call \"self beyond self.\" These are the three. And of these three senses of self, normally what we experience is the first two, the unhealthy and healthy sense of self. We experience these a lot in our life. And we do not experience the luminous self normally. The whole purpose here, in level three, is to connect with this and to go, from the surface level, deeper and deeper into yourself, into your true nature. On the surface, we have the unhealthy sense of self. But when you look behind the unhealthy sense of self or at the essence of the unhealthy sense of self, what you will discover is the healthy sense of self. And this is with us all the time, the healthy sense of self. Then, when you look deeper into the healthy sense of self, what you will discover is the luminous self or self beyond self. This one, the third one, is our true nature, the fundamental level of who we are. Of course, we will discuss this and practice this step by step — do not worry about knowing it right now. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Be patient. These are three layers. Although we use the words \"unhealthy\" and \"healthy,\" \"unhealthy\" does not mean you are a bad person or you are not good. It is not like that. The important thing is that we all have these three, and especially the luminous self is with us all the time. It is never separate from us. That is who we are. But the unhealthy and healthy senses of self are sometimes there and sometimes not. They are changing. Now, I would like to introduce, on a general level, these three senses of self. The first is the unhealthy sense of self, the self in which we perceive ourselves as permanent, independent, and single. Sometimes we say \"singular,\" \"independent,\" and \"permanent.\" Of course, you will know more about this later. Single means one. \"Me, me, me.\" Solid, single, one. \"I am important.\" \"Me first.\" \"I have to win.\" \"I have to be number one.\" There is always this, \"What about me? What about me? I have to win. Others have to lose.\" Or, \"My idea is better. My way is the best.\" \"My guru is better.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Single, number one, the best, trying to categorize. That is singularity. And the second is independence. \"Independent\" means that we want to have everything in our hands. We want to have control. We want everything to be free, by itself. We feel there is no need to depend on anything. You know independence, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Nowadays, many people talk about independence. It is really important, right? Maybe, in your country, it is very important. And number three is the self that does not want to change. The self wants to have stability. It really wants to have consistency. It is looking for some kind of consistency. We do not want to have unexpected surprises. We do not want to change; we want to be solid. These are the three: singularity, independence, and permanence. And these three are actually one. What I am telling you is from different aspects, but they are actually just one. Combine these three together, and you have the unhealthy sense of self. But the reason why I say \"unhealthy\" is if you are only fixated on that, if you only believe in that, if you only believe in your self, only in that, that is the problem. Then you become very narrow, and for the self it becomes easy to cry, easy to explode, easy to disappear, easy to burn, easy to freeze, easy to melt. It is very sensitive. And that brings with it a lot of issues with your friends and family. But at the same time, this sense of self is also a manifestation of wisdom. I told you, in the beginning, about the example of an elephant, right? When you look at the elephant's leg, the elephant looks like a tree. The elephant looks like a drum when you look at its stomach. The elephant looks like a fan when you only look at its ear. These are parts of the elephant, it is true. That is why we say the sense of self is also a manifestation of wisdom. In our true nature, there is unity. There is kind of a sense of singularity in our true nature; everything is one. So there is some truth in it, and this wisdom is manifesting. But if we are only fixated on that, that is a problem. And independence. Our true nature has a quality of independence, but that is not the only quality; it is one part of the qualities. So we experience that. Our true nature does not change. It is very stable — the third sense of self, number three, the luminous self. But that is not the only quality, so if you fixate on that, that is the problem. When I say everything is a manifestation of wisdom, that is true, but we really need to see the full picture of ourselves. If we are only fixated on parts, that is the problem. The second is the healthy sense of self. It is the opposite of these three. It is multiple, interdependent, and impermanent. When we realize these three, that the self is more connected with these three, that is healthier, freer, and more open. And we can connect with others more. There is love and compassion, awareness, wisdom, flexibility, and creativity. We are quite happy and healthy. But that is also wisdom because the luminous self also has many qualities. A lot of pieces are there. And from the luminous self come a lot of interdependent connections. And in the luminous self, various things are changing and manifesting. So there is truth in it. Now, you will know what the luminous self is, right? The luminous self is the unhealthy and healthy combined. The luminous self is neither permanent nor impermanent, but it has both qualities, the quality of permanence and the quality of impermanence. It is like that. All these are the three senses of self. So then, that is the full picture of who we are. We are going to explore this step by step to see who we are. How to do that? How can we connect with that? Normally, it is through awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom. You already know awareness from level one and love and compassion from level two. Now, we will connect with awareness and love and compassion on a deeper level, and that becomes wisdom. For example, when you see the unhealthy sense of self, that is wisdom. How amazing, isn't it? Normally, we are not aware of the unhealthy sense of self. So then we are lost. But, when we are aware of the unhealthy sense of self, we do not have to get rid of the unhealthy sense of self. We do not need to change the unhealthy sense of self. We just need to be aware of it, and that is already wisdom. And that is how we can connect, from the unhealthy to the healthy and, eventually, the luminous sense of self. These are the practices of level three. What we call \"wisdom\" means exploring the nature of reality. Here, when you have an unhealthy sense of self, that feeling is there with you, isn't it? For the relative level. When you see the sense or that feeling as it is, then that has become wisdom. We will explore this step by step. I will see you in the next video.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche says that often we are not aware of the unhealthy sense of self.

Now, we will look deeper into ourselves. First, I would like to focus more on the unhealthy and healthy sense of self. As you already know from the first course, there are three senses of self: the unhealthy, healthy, and luminous self. The first two — unhealthy and healthy — also have three aspects each. The unhealthy sense of self has the aspects of permanence, independence, and singularity. And the healthy sense of self has the opposite of those: impermanent, interdependent, and multiple. As for the order, impermanence or multiplicity could be first, it varies. Now, here, I will use the example of growing an apple. If we want to grow an apple, what kind of causes and conditions do we need? Of course, soil, moisture, water, air, oxygen, seeds, fertilizer, sunlight . . . All these things, right? So there are many pieces. All of these are pieces. Normally, we do not see the pieces. We need to see the pieces, and then we need to relate these pieces together. If you just leave the pieces there, it might not work. If there is just soil, there will be no apple. If there is just the seed of the apple, there will be no apple. If there is just water, there will be no apple. They need to connect with each other. And then, once they are all connected with each other, we have to wait for time to pass. It has to change and change, and then one day we will have a result. That is how things are. We will discuss, particularly in this section, the pieces and how we do not see those pieces. At the unhealthy level, we do not see the pieces. On the healthy level, we see the pieces. And second, is how these pieces are related. On the unhealthy level, we do not see this relationship. But on the healthy level, we see the relationship. You will learn this in this course.\nWelcome from Lucas Henriksson Read\nHi, and welcome to this course. This is Lucas. Most of you are probably familiar with me at this point, having gone through the previous levels in this Joy of Living series. In this course, we will continue from where we were left off in the previous course and begin to dive deeper into the so-called three characteristics of impermanence, interdependence, and multiplicity. And, in particular, we will focus on two of the three characteristics here, starting out with multiplicity and then moving on to interdependence. There is so much to say on this topic, as probably will become apparent as you go through this level. As we continue to study and practice, deeper and deeper layers of the wisdom that imbues the view of these three characteristics will start to become manifest, not just on a theoretical or intellectual level, but in our lives and in our own experience of ourselves and the world around us. I hope you will enjoy this course and find it beneficial. I know that I certainly will. And Myoshin and I will do our best to clarify difficult points you may stumble upon as you engage in this material. But more importantly, we will be here as fellow meditators to explore and engage in these practices with you. We can all connect in the webinars and forums. And I would really encourage you all to take the chance here to interact with each other in the forums, to share your experiences and dialogue with one another around questions and reflections you may have. To connect in this way can really strengthen the sense of community around what we are doing here together. With these words, again, a big welcome, and I am really looking forward to this time together. See you soon. Welcome from Myoshin Kelley Read\nHi, everyone! My name is Myoshin Kelley, for those who do not know me, and Lucas Henriksson and I will be the guides for course two of Awakening Wisdom on multiplicity and interdependence. I cannot tell you how excited I am to be here with you. These teachings and practices in my own life have just led to such an unbinding and a loosening of this fixation of self. And out of that, there is just a lot more space, joy, and fluidity in life and a much healthier way — when I remember, when I see clearly — of being engaged in life and coming closer to our natural home. In the first course, we were practicing with two different styles of meditation, as we really looked at the unbinding of this fixation of self. And with that, there was the style of analytical meditation where we sharpen perception in a way. And to me, it has always felt like there is a turning on of the lights in the mind, and that, with that, with a stable mind, where we are looking into our own experience and questioning some of the beliefs, perceptions, and concepts that bind us — by just beginning to see them and to know that they are coloring our experience — it really helps to kind of break that fixation or that sense that this is the truth of the way things are so that we can begin to see the way things actually are. Then there is also the resting meditation, where we just look inward at this fixation of self, the subtle sense that seems like it just follows us, haunts us, and is always there. But then we start to gently look, be with, allow, accept. And for me, this is one of the greatest aspects of this practice. Earlier in my life, I really struggled with pain from the sense of self, from the fixation of ego, and feeling like, \"I need to get rid of this! This is too painful. I do not want this. I do not want to see this.\" And then, just finding the freedom that comes when we see it and allow it with awareness — it is so much freer than that heavy-duty fighting that we can get pulled into. We are going to continue to practice with these two styles as we go into the aspects of multiplicity — or how things are not so singular as they appear and how there are all these component parts, and also that all these component parts are actually in an interdependent relationship. These two aspects are just so helpful in our being able to live in a world where things are in relationship. We are not alone. We get influenced in a day by so many different factors, and it just makes it so much less impersonal to be able to see this. But it also helps us to be able to connect with the world around us in a way that it is not foreign, it is not separate — we are in this together. And so there is just so much that comes from our working deeply, looking into our own experience to see what is so. And that is really the invitation of this course. Mingyur Rinpoche is probably going to be presenting us with things that, at times, might challenge what we believe reality to be. The invitation is to look, follow the instructions, and discover what is there for you. And really let this be a practice of discovery because that is where it is really alive and dynamic, and we are not, then, just looking through more concepts and beliefs, but we are actually seeing through the concepts and beliefs that keep us restricted. I am really looking forward to this time with you and to being in the forums with you. And really, just remember it gets hard to express some of this stuff. So just have a go at it because that in itself is a great exercise for you, and it also benefits everybody else. And we can stay and dialogue with what is happening. I am looking forward to going through this program with you. Thank you.

Now, when you go out, bring awareness. Wisdom is knowing things as they are. Whatever the sense of self is, healthy or unhealthy, does not matter. Just bring awareness to the sense of self, and in particular, try to see, try to be aware, that the unhealthy sense of self here is singularity, if you experience that normally. Low self-esteem, selfishness, or arrogance — whatever you have does not matter. I will give you particular homework. Try to write it down, especially when a trigger comes. We have a lot of triggers. Boom! Suddenly [Mingyur Rinpoche raises his fist as if he were angry]. Then, you can make that trigger a reminder of awareness, like setting an alarm. [Minyur Rinpoche laughs.] Sometimes we have our reminders, right? The trigger can be a reminder to bring awareness. So be with that. That would be vertical liberation. And you can write it down. Also, when this singularity, this unhealthy sense of self, comes, what kind of images are there? What kind of voices are there? What kind of sensations are present in the body? There is sensation. What kind of beliefs? \"Should.\" \"This is the way.\" \"This is right!\" Some of these beliefs are at an unconscious level, and we did not know before. Write those down also. And a sensation is sometimes triggered. [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.] Boom! It comes. You know. So how is it, and from where? [Mingyur Rinpoche gestures toward his heart.] From the heart or from your entire body? And during which time of the day does it come more? Morning? Evening? Sometimes more in the morning, sometimes more in the evening — it depends on the person. Then, with which kind of people does it come, out of those you encounter in your life? Bringing more awareness is better. We do not need to do anything. I am not saying that you have to judge. You do not need to say this is bad. And as I told you before, there is some truth in it. This is a radiation of our true nature. I mentioned this in level two, right? Looking for happiness and not wanting to suffer is a sign of our true nature because our true nature has happiness, and our true nature is free from suffering. Therefore, we are longing to go back to our home. Remember? It is the same thing here. Even though it is unhealthy, in a way there is truth in it. We will discover this slowly, slowly. Do not worry, do not judge. Just bring awareness. Awareness is like the light. When the light comes, the darkness automatically goes away.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nAs you begin each day, set a motivation to remember to practice throughout the day. Bring to mind a challenging situation or individual in your life that reifies your sense of self, particularly in terms of the feeling of singularity. This often manifests as a feeling of low self-esteem or pride. Take a few moments to reflect on this and then write down what constitutes this unhealthy sense of self. It could be words, images, beliefs, or sensations. Once you do this, set the intention to be aware of this sense of self as it arises in moments of provocation. Remember this is a practice and may take some time.\nAt the end of the day, take a moment to rejoice if you were able to recognize the sense of self. If you forgot to practice, you do not need to judge yourself. Instead, set another intention for the next day. Remember, it is a gradual process to build up a healthy habit of bringing awareness to your patterns.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nAs you recognize the unhealthy and healthy sense of self manifesting in daily life, do they affect your experience of seeing yourself as you truly are? If so, please explain.&nbsp;\nDo these practices help you see yourself more clearly and cultivate a wholesome way to relate to challenging situations? Please explain.\nTip\n\"Nonjudgment\" means you are allowed to judge. If you are not allowed to judge, it is not truly nonjudgmental.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.1 Welcome to Multiplicity and Interdependence Summary\" data-href=\"3.2.1 Welcome to Multiplicity and Interdependence Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.1 Welcome To Multiplicity And Interdependence, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.1 welcome to multiplicity and interdependence, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.1 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Multiplicity and Self: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Multiplicity_and_Self_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475866,"modifiedTime":1759272587430,"sourceSize":5104,"sourcePath":"1.

Being someone who has always been interested in the deeper, maybe more existential, questions of life, even as a child, coming in contact with these teachings in my early twenties was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Here I was, surrounded by a whole tradition that has sort of created a map for how to work on and reflect on these questions. Beginning to get the tools for testing if what I came up with as answers to these questions could stand up to analysis or not was incredibly inspiring. And not only that, but there were also methods for applying this in meditation and in daily life, and not leaving it as strictly an intellectual exercise.&nbsp;\nThis tool and exploration of being able to test my own assumptions of how things are, how they exist, who I am, and how I exist has been one of, if not the most, rewarding and satisfying undertakings of my life. To have a way of moving beyond simply guessing and actually be able to test things, and to practice with it to be able to see and get an experience or a glimpse of how the grasping to the seeming solidity of myself, my world, my opinions, etc. begins to open up and become a little bit more spacious — that has been tremendously rewarding, and it has also simply made life more interesting and joyful. It could also be a really helpful tool to have when life sometimes gets a little bit tougher.\nIn short, to begin to question how things are and to have the tools for applying this questioning in practice is, in my experience, one of the most profound, eye-opening, and rewarding experiences one can have.&nbsp;\nI hope you enjoy the material in this section, and I am looking forward to hearing from you and engaging in conversation with you in the forums.

It does not matter which one. The main thing is to bring awareness to it again and again. There is something funny here, and this funny thing is related with the unhealthy sense of self. Here, we are focusing on singularity. I think you know about singularity right? \"My group is better.\" \"My idea is better.\" Or, \"I have to be number one. What about me? I have to win. If others lose, no problem.\" Or there is a sense of things being one, solid, strong. These are the unhealthy sense of self.\nMaybe I will give you one more example now. If you are on a sports team and your group wins, what do you think? \"Yes, of course!\" Right? But if your group loses, then what will you think? \"Something happened here!\" Maybe the referee is not good. Maybe someone tricked them. Maybe someone did something to undermine them. Or, the weather was not good this time. Something like that. So our self-image is sometimes strong. Or maybe it is on the other side. Low self-esteem, self-hatred, or depression are also possible. All of these are what we call the \"unhealthy sense of self,\" but that does not mean these are bad. It depends on how we take or receive these.\nNow, here, in the meditation, we are not going to judge. We can just be with that. But one funny thing is that, with the unhealthy sense of self, when you look you cannot find it. It does not matter. In this stage, we just try to be with whatever sense of singularity or unhealthy self or whatever you have, and just look at that, be with that. If you cannot find it, that is okay. Be with not being able to find it. If you can find it, wonderful! But do not make it. Do not create an unhealthy sense of self. If you do not feel it, do not make it. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It may seem like I am saying to make it, but do not make it.\nOkay. Now, please keep your spine loosely straight. And relax the muscles in your body. If you cannot relax, that is also okay, right? From the perspective of wisdom, on a fundamental level, we all are fine. So do not worry. Just be, as it is.\nNow, ask the question, \"Who am I? Where am I?\" and maybe you will see the singular sense of self. \"I am the best,\" or \"I am the worst.\" \"I have to win. I do not care about others.\" Or, \"I cannot preserve happiness. I am not worthy to be happy.\" Or, \"My idea is the best. My way is better.\" Or, \"I am totally confused.\" Allow whatever experience you are having — the sense, the feeling, the idea, the belief in a self. Just be with that. Allow whatever is there. Do not fight with it. Do not control it. Do not try to create it. Do nothing. Just be with whatever is in your mind, in your feelings, or in your perception.\nMaybe you cannot see anything. There is a gap. Great! Be with the gap.\n[Silent meditation]\nMaybe you find your body or your mind. That is also okay. Or, on a basic level, you might find the sense of self, \"me\" as one, a single \"me.\" That is also okay.\nOkay. Now, please rest your mind in open awareness. Just be, as it is.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay, now we have finished this meditation.&nbsp;\nThank you! 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n150 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Find a comfortable posture that supports you in being upright and relaxed. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nTake a few slow, calming breaths.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, drop all the mental effort, and rest in open awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply be present. &nbsp;\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice As you rest in open awareness, notice how there is a subtle, but pervasive, sense of self — the feeling of an \"I\" or \"me\" doing this meditation — which accompanies every moment of experience. Simply notice and rest your awareness with this sense of self.\nNow, explore how the sense of self relates to different experiences. For example, notice how there is a sense or feeling of an \"I\" or \"me\" possessing a body and the five sensory experiences, including seeing, hearing, etc. &nbsp;\nNext, notice what is happening in your mind. Are there words, images, thoughts, feelings, impulses, or reactions playing out in the field of awareness? Take a moment, and simply notice what is happening in your mind, right now. Then, try to notice the subtle sense or feeling of \"I\" or \"me\" that is experiencing all of these thoughts, emotions, and reactions. Notice the pervasive presence of a sense of \"I\" that accompanies every experience.&nbsp;\nNext, bring your awareness to the movement of the breath. You do not need to analyze your breathing, but simply notice how it feels to breathe in this moment. Then, notice the sense of an \"I\" that is accompanying this simple experience of breathing. &nbsp;&nbsp;\nIf your mind gets distracted when doing analytical meditation, that is completely normal. You do not need to stop your mind from wandering, but simply notice it. The moment you remember, you are no longer lost and can continue where you left off.\nNow, drop what you are doing, and just rest in open, effortless awareness.&nbsp;\nWhen you feel ready, bring your awareness back to the subtle but pervasive sense of self. This time, you do not need to focus on anything in particular. Just notice whatever naturally enters the field of awareness, such as the breath, physical sensations, sensory experiences, thoughts, or emotions. Notice all of these as they come and go, while being accompanied by the sense of an \"I\" that is experiencing them all. Be curious, and see what you notice.\nNow, ask yourself, \"What do I most strongly identify with?\" It could be a certain emotional pattern, gender, race, religion, job, etc. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here. Just ask the question and see what comes up.&nbsp;\nAfter some time, think about the different roles you play in your life. Ask yourself, \"What roles do I identify with most strongly?\" It could be that of being a parent, a friend, or anything else. Notice the role you identify with and how it is accompanied by a strong sense of self.\nNext, do the same investigation with emotional patterns. Ask the question, \"What emotions define who I am?\" You might think of a short temper, anxiety, sadness, or depression. Again, do not judge these as good or bad. The point is simply to see them clearly. Be curious, and notice what you find.\nContinue to examine your sense of self with regard to your beliefs. What do you strongly believe in? Perhaps you have a strong political belief or religious framework that you identify with. Again, this could be anything; there is no right or wrong. Notice if there are any strong belief systems that are tied to the sense of self and how you identify.&nbsp;\nThis time, leave the question a little more open-ended. What truly defines you? Just ask the question, and examine what comes up within the field of awareness. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End session Let go of the investigation, and simply rest in open awareness.\nSlowly open your eyes if they have been closed. Look around, and take in what you see and hear with a sense of appreciation and warmth.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When doing this practice of simply noticing how there is a subtle sense of self that accompanies an emotional or thought pattern you experience, is there any difference in how you relate to who you are? Please explain.When you ask yourself, \"What do I most strongly identify with?\" you might think of the roles you have in relationship to others. How does this contemplation inform the way you relate to yourself and/or others? Please explain.Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Inquiry\nHow could you use the experience of identifying with roles and/or belief systems as an opportunity to deepen your practice?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.1 Welcome to Multiplicity and Interdependence Application\" data-href=\"3.2.1 Welcome to Multiplicity and Interdependence Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.1 Welcome To Multiplicity And Interdependence, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.1 welcome to multiplicity and interdependence, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Multiplicity and Self: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Multiplicity_and_Self_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475854,"modifiedTime":1759272587446,"sourceSize":9615,"sourcePath":"1.

Normally, in our meditation tradition, we talk about \"out\" and \"in\" — we do not talk about up and down, or high and low. What we call \"out\" is samsara and \"in\" is nirvana. \"Out\" is a cause of suffering; \"in\" is a cause of happiness and freedom. So, the real answer is here, within us. We cannot find it \"out there.\" Once you are free from here, once you are liberated from here, then you can be free everywhere. Once you have real happiness that comes from within, then there is no need to depend on outside circumstances. Real happiness, lasting happiness, comes from within. Otherwise, even if you go to Shangri-La or Paradise, suffering will follow you like a shadow. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Up there, down there, or wherever we go. Therefore, it is very important to look at the self. And then there is unlimited discovery within yourself. It is amazing! How to discover this for yourself? There are two tools here. One is resting. Resting meditation without analyzing. We did that before. And the second is analyzing or analytical meditation. Now, we will do analytical meditation. In analytical meditation, you need to ask questions. So, look at your mind, look at yourself, and ask, \"Who am I? Where am I? Who is this 'me, me, me'?\" The question format is up to you. Which way you want to put it is up to you. But this is analytical meditation, so you constantly ask yourself questions. In level one, we have this idea of giving a job to the monkey mind, right? If you listen to monkey mind, monkey mind will become your boss. If you try to fight with monkey mind, monkey mind becomes your enemy. The best way is to give a job to monkey mind. If you can give a job to monkey mind, you become the boss. The monkey mind becomes your employee, and you become the employer. You become the boss. Now, we will give a job to monkey mind. What kind of job? That is very important. In level one, the job is kind of neutral. You ask monkey mind to listen to sounds, and then you connect with awareness. Basically, that really helps. Our mind becomes more pliable and workable. In level two, the job is to explore love and compassion. We give monkey mind the job of exploring love and compassion. Here, the main job is to ask questions, to see the nature of reality, to see the nature of yourself. Now, the question is, \"Who am I?\" I think you asked yourself this question in the past. What was your experience? When you look for the self and ask, \"Who am I?\" what answer comes? There are five answers, roughly. When we do a classification, there are roughly five of them. The first one is that normally we have a sense of the self being singular. \"Me, me, me.\" When we look at ourselves, we have three layers. The outer layer is what I call \"unhealthy.\" And here we will focus on singularity. The inner layer is multiplicity, the healthy sense of self. Then, the real core, the essence, is self beyond self. What is self beyond self? I will not tell you so much about it now. Here, we will discuss more the healthy and unhealthy sense of self. Maybe I should ask you a question. The question here is, \"How many Mingyur Rinpoches are giving this talk?\" One Mingyur Rinpoche? Or are there many Mingyur Rinpoches here? Of course, we say \"one Mingyur Rinpoche,\" right? But actually, we give the name \"Mingyur Rinpoche\" to this body. I have this particular body, I have a mind, and I have different titles, my position, my job. There are so many pieces there. But what we perceive in our mind is a sense of oneness, of singularity. A sense of wanting to be the best. Or sometimes it becomes the opposite. It becomes low self-esteem. We can perceive the self-image as \"my idea is better,\" \"my way is better,\" or sometimes that becomes turned around. \"My idea is not good. My idea is the worst.\" \"People do not like me.\" It may become low self-esteem, or self-hatred sometimes, or sometimes we may fall into depression. Sometimes it becomes arrogance. It is about you, also. So whatever your name is, do you normally think of \"me\" as one, or many? Normally, we think of \"me\" as one. And, at the same time, we do not want to see. Our mind is a little bit lazy. We do not want to see all the pieces and details. Instead, we try to categorize things. We try to make classifications. \"My group, their group.\" We have this sense of, \"My idea is better, my way is better.\" If people ask for your comments, you think you see quite nicely what is right. There is a lot of research on taxi drivers in which they were asked about their driving skills. I think about 70% of the taxi drivers said their driving skills are above average. When you and your friend are together in the car, going somewhere, and then the road is bumpy, or you almost get into an accident, do you think, \"If I drive, it will be safer\"? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Do you feel that? That is a self-image. And that self-image is one of singularity. \"I am the best. I want to be number one. I have to be first. What about me?\" \"I have to win. If others lose, it is no problem. I do not care about that.\" From that, we also have a lot of social problems, like with different skin colors. \"My skin color is better. Theirs is not good.\" Or castes. In some cultures, there are different castes. \"This caste is better.\" And between different cultures, there are these conflicts, all this fighting, and not agreeing with each other, which comes from the view of singularity. And that singularity sometimes goes to the other side and becomes low self-esteem. Many people feel that people do not like them. They feel a little bit useless, like a failure. And this is normal. All these things are there. And this sense of self is something everybody experiences. Some people experience it for a longer time. If you experience it for a long time, that is not good. Maybe try to do some meditation here. Or sometimes, in extreme cases, you can check into therapies. Do some physical exercise, also. That really helps. But here, in level three, we will learn meditation to work with that. Here, I focus more on the unhealthy sense of self, and the main important practice is just to be with that. Wisdom is just seeing whatever you are feeling. Normally we do not see that; we are lost. Remember, when you see the river, you are out of the river. But normally we fall into the river and get carried away by the river. Normally, we fall into the unhealthy sense of self, and we are carried away by that. But now, be with that.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nTo illustrate the importance of recognizing both the healthy and unhealthy sense of self, Mingyur Rinpoche asks the question, \"How many Mingyur Rinpoches are there?\" He then describes the different elements that constitute who he is, such as his body, name, mind, titles, positions, etc. This is an example of multiplicity, which is an aspect of the healthy sense of self. However, most often our belief is that we are single entities. This defines the unhealthy sense of self. Can you provide an example from your own life that illustrates this notion of you being a singular entity?\nPoints to remember:\nReal happiness is found within.\nThrough analytical meditation, we ask questions to see the nature of reality and who we truly are.\nWe often perceive the world exclusively through the unhealthy sense of self.\nWhen we look at the sense of self deeply, we see that we are composed of many layers and pieces.\nDefinition\n&nbsp;Lhaktong&nbsp;in Tibetan and&nbsp;vipashyana&nbsp;in Sanskrit are traditionally translated as \"insight.\" More literally, they mean \"superior seeing\" or \"seeing beyond.\"\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout another deluded belief about \"I\"\nmethods for recognizing your fundamental nature\nabout examples that illuminate subtle delusion Joyful Wisdom, pp. 109-110 (Ch. 5: \"Singularity\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.1 Welcome to Multiplicity and Interdependence Meditation\" data-href=\"3.2.1 Welcome to Multiplicity and Interdependence Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.1 Welcome To Multiplicity And Interdependence, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.1 welcome to multiplicity and interdependence, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.1 View","our mind is a little bit lazy"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Multiplicity and Self: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Multiplicity_and_Self_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.1-welcome-to-multiplicity-and-interdependence-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475840,"modifiedTime":1759272587458,"sourceSize":9380,"sourcePath":"1.

Look at a table. How many pieces are there? There are four legs, a cover, and all these together are what we call a \"table.\" Normally, we think, \"There is one table here.\" We categorize. We put everything into one thing, but that one thing is not a separate entity, by itself, because that one thing is relying on the pieces coming together. A chair. A car — a car has so many pieces. A person, a house, a building.\nAnd look at your own life, whatever you do, your job. See the pieces there. You may not have seen the pieces before at your workplace. Now, maybe you can start to see the pieces, and you will see where there is something wrong or where you need to put more attention.\nAnd look at your own practice. We need a lot of pieces, right? Awareness. And first, we need to recognize that awareness and maintain it. And in order to learn awareness, we have to learn, we have to contemplate. We have the view, meditation, and application. There are many pieces there. If we are missing one [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs], then it may not be a good experience. So try to see this.\nAnd when you are faced with suffering or a problem, look at that emotion itself. Or look at \"you\" — the low self-esteem you, or the arrogant you. Look at that. At that moment, look at \"you\" and you will see the pieces.\nOne interesting exercise is to try to find a thing without pieces. A thing that is not made up of pieces. A phenomenon that is not made up of pieces.

Welcome to this next section. In this part, we are going to be looking towards the wisdom of multiplicity, remembering that this is not a wisdom that comes through intellectual knowledge, but really through direct seeing. This is the wisdom that is there when we are at ease, at peace, with being able to see all of these multiple component parts that build up the world we live in, that the building blocks of self and of the world are made up of. This is where we really start to see the wisdom that goes, \"Oh! Wait a minute, hang on. There are a lot of different components that are here.\" And as we look at each of these components, we begin to see, \"Ooh, this is not quite the way I had it figured out. It is not quite the way I understood reality to be.\" But then, when we start relaxing and being okay with this, we start to get the taste of what wisdom is and how, on this relative level of experience, we can be okay with having so many different pieces that make up what we call \"self.\" It actually becomes, for me anyway, a little bit comical to see this because it can go from being one horrible person to being multiple parts that are changing throughout the day. \"Who am I?\" You really cannot say it in quite the way that you did before. And there is something quite lightening about this. And so this is where we are moving towards this healthy sense of self, where this is okay and we can actually live within this. So I am looking forward to seeing you in the forum, to seeing how your exploration goes, and to seeing what you discover from doing this practice. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.2 Wisdom of Multiplicity View\" data-href=\"3.2.2 Wisdom of Multiplicity View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.2 Wisdom Of Multiplicity, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.2 wisdom of multiplicity, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Wisdom of Multiplicity (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Wisdom_of_Multiplicity_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475818,"modifiedTime":1759272587479,"sourceSize":2255,"sourcePath":"1.

And either way of practicing is okay. You can use the resting part and just be with the sense, feeling, or notion of self. Or you can ask questions like, \"Where am I? Who am I? What is this?\" It does not matter. When we ask these questions, there are five experiences. We categorize them into five. There are various experiences, so many, but mainly there are five. First, what we see are pieces. For some people, there are a lot of pieces. Like before, when you asked, \"Where am I?\" you may have thought of your body, ideas, images, your name, or feelings. These thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and images come to mind. We see ourselves as pieces. We do not see ourselves as singular. Even if you see it as being singular, that means you are seeing the feeling of singularity. You are seeing the idea of singularity. Normally, we see ourselves as singular. But now, when you see that, that means you see the idea. You see that you are seeing singularity. You have become bigger. Do you get it? You are not in the water. Even if you feel like you are in the water, you know you feel like you are in the water, which means you are out of the water. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You know all this from level one. This is really important. This is why we have to practice level one first. Once we are quite familiar with level one, now level three becomes very easy, actually. It is the same idea, the same thing. Remember, for all these practices, we do not need to change anything. Your fundamental nature is good. You have a luminous self. With all of these practices, we do not need to change to become better people. We are already good. What we are doing is just seeing things as they are. By seeing them as they are and knowing that we do not need to change, in the end, we change. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You see pieces, or sometimes you see different perspectives. The second one is interdependence. Or you see how things are changing and changing. Or you cannot see anything. When you look at yourself, maybe now some of you look at the sense of \"me\" and have a gap. That is very good! When you look at the sense of self and cannot find it, that is really good wisdom. This is nonconceptual wisdom or wisdom beyond self. You are experiencing this, so be with that. The fifth is that it seems like the unhealthy sense of self becomes stronger. But when you can be with a strong unhealthy sense of self, it is the same thing as seeing the river. Now, we will do this practice together, and it does not matter what kind of experience you have. If you feel \"I am confused,\" if you feel the self is confused, be with that. Then, that becomes meditation. Please keep your spine loosely straight. And first, rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Now, please be with the sense of self. Maybe you cannot see anything, there is a gap. Great! Be with the gap. Or you may see yourself as a lot of pieces: images, an image of yourself, your body, your mind, words, your name, feelings, emotions, or beliefs about yourself. When you see these pieces, then the single, touchy, sensitive self lessens. Maybe you have very strong emotions. When I was young, I had very strong panic. When I looked at the self, the self felt, \"I am panicking! It is dangerous! This is a problem!\" It felt very strong and solid. But when I really looked into that, the panic was not just singular, like a rock. Normally, what I saw was that panic was like a huge rock, rolling over me. But then, when I really observed the panic, the panic had so many pieces. Please look at the pieces. It does not matter if it is panic, depression, anger, low self-esteem, or stress. Whatever emotion or suffering you have, it has a physical sensation. Maybe the sensation is in the entire body but mainly around the heart, head, shoulders, or stomach. Be aware of that. And there are images — an image of something frightening or, with anger, an image of a person you do not like. And there are voices. Most of these voices are automatic. \"Blah, blah, blah.\" \"This is terrible and dangerous. I am having a problem. Maybe I am having a heart attack.\" There are many conversations within you. Behind that, there are beliefs. \"This is not good. I hate this. I want to get rid of this.\" Now, panic becomes pieces; depression becomes pieces; the stress becomes pieces; hatred becomes pieces; anger becomes pieces. And who is angry? Me. But \"me\" is also made up of pieces. The solid, single \"me\" is only an idea. It does not exist by itself, separate from these pieces. And the object of that emotion is also made up of pieces. Now, when you see this, the panic is not like a rock anymore. It is like what I call \"shaving foam.\" When you shave, you use shaving foam. It looks like a piece of rock when you look from the outside. But inside it is full of bubbles, full of space. [Silent meditation] If you cannot find those emotions, great! When you look at a destructive emotion, you cannot find it, nor the one who is destructed, \"me.\" Great! Be with that.If the emotion becomes too strong, then change something. Try something different, step back, or take a break. You can practice those. Now, please rest your mind in open awareness. [Silent meditation] Okay. 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n180 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 6 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding a comfortable body posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease and relaxation.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.\nNext, take a few deep breaths. On the exhalation, simply let be, and rest in open awareness. Main practice Now, ask yourself, \"Is there a sense of 'I' or 'me' present?\" and see what comes up in your experience. You can practice this as resting meditation, simply being aware of the felt sense of \"I.\" Once you are aware of it, you are no longer confined by the prison of \"me.\"\nAlternatively, you can practice this with analytical meditation. Ask yourself, \"Who am I?\" and notice how the sense of self is made up of multiple components like images, beliefs, thoughts, body sensations, and emotions. Pick one of these aspects, look at it, and recognize how it, too, has different components.&nbsp;\nWhen you have awareness of the whole experience of that which seems solid or fixed, you can break it into pieces that are insubstantial, yet connected.&nbsp;\nIf you get too tight or overly energized by the analysis, simply rest in open awareness for a period of time. Then, when you are ready, look again at the sense of self with fresh eyes, asking \"Who am I now?\"&nbsp;\nAt times, you might experience a gap of no thoughts or no sense of self. That is okay. Just be aware of it, and let be.&nbsp;\nThe sense of self is made up of many components. Simply be aware of this, and let be.&nbsp; End session Let go of any inquiries, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you look at the sense of self while in resting meditation, or as you ask questions in analytical meditation, what do you notice?Mingyur Rinpoche says that there is no need to change whatever experiences you have, even when the unhealthy sense of self becomes stronger or the sense of self cannot be found. How would you explain this to a friend or colleague?Inquiry\nWhat is resistance informing you about the sense of self?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.2 Wisdom of Multiplicity Application\" data-href=\"3.2.2 Wisdom of Multiplicity Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.2 Wisdom Of Multiplicity, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.2 wisdom of multiplicity, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.2 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Wisdom of Multiplicity: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Wisdom_of_Multiplicity_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475818,"modifiedTime":1759272587487,"sourceSize":8900,"sourcePath":"1.

When you need to cook, first you have to have all the pieces together — maybe all the vegetables, and you have to have knives to cut the vegetables and a place to cut them. You need different types of vegetables. You have to have a stove or some kind of heat, like a fire. You have to have a pot or container to cook. You need water, salt, pepper, ingredients — all the different pieces. There are so many pieces, aren't there? And these pieces also have other pieces. Maybe salt has many different pieces, which are related back to how to collect the salt and where it comes from. There are so many pieces there.\nOnce all the pieces come together, these pieces are what we call \"multiplicity,\" in the relative truth, or what we sometimes call the \"true relative.\" Singularity, how we perceive, is the fake relative. We assume that it exists, but it actually does not exist. What does exist is the multiplicity, the true relative. Although it is relative, it is true relative. There are so many pieces.\nThen, after you have the pieces what do you have to do? You have to make a connection between them. This is interdependence. Now, you put the container on the stove, heat the fire, put the water in or fry it, add the oil, and all the ingredients and vegetables. You have to link all of these together. That is what we call \"interdependence\" — to make a connection between them. They are linked to each other and dependent on each other. Then, we need time. It has to change. There is ripening, changing, cooking. Then, after a certain level, you will have a result. The aspect of time, change, and evolution is impermanence. Then you have the result. That is how we are, actually. In everything in our life, whatever we do, we have these three aspects. But normally we do not see that.&nbsp;\nIn the last section, I focused on the unhealthy aspect, that of singularity, right? With singularity, we try to categorize everything. We try to unify everything: \"My group, their group, my culture, my particular idea, my cause,\" or \"my particular skin color.\" I told you before that all of Joy of Living is about seeing things as they are. So once you bring the awareness to them. . . do you remember? In level one, we talked about how, when you see the river, you are out of the river, although the river is there. Here it is the same thing. When you look at the sense of self, even though you see the idea of singularity you are actually free from that, although it is there. This is vertical liberation.&nbsp;\nI think I asked you to do homework, to look at the unhealthy sense of self. Now, maybe what you see when you look at the \"me\" — maybe you did the resting one, looking at the sense of self. Or maybe you asked questions: \"Where am I? Who am I?\" Most of the time, what you will discover is that you may see your body, right? You may see your mind. And in the body, there are a lot of pieces. Flesh, bones, different organs, and the five senses. There are so many pieces. And in the end, it comes down to an atom. The atom also has subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, electrons. It has so many pieces. And the mind also has pieces, right? The mind has images, voices, feelings, and sensations. Then there are all these different mental factors, like anger, hatred, ignorance, jealousy, happiness, love, compassion, and awareness. There are so many pieces. Where is the single \"me\"? The single \"me\" is just an idea. When you look for it, you cannot really find it. Maybe you will find it as an idea. From the ground level, what you have is all these pieces. For example, when we look in the sky and many birds fly together, then these birds come together and form the shape of an airplane. They look like an airplane up there, but actually, they are just birds. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So, when all of these pieces come together, we see the sense of self as one.&nbsp;\nNow, we are seeing pieces, right? How many of you see pieces? If you see pieces, raise your hand. If, when you look at yourself, you see pieces, raise your hand. Images, voices, a body, feelings, ideas, beliefs, etc. There are so many things. That is actually good. Seeing pieces is really important. In everyday life, it is also very important because normally, with singularity, we want to categorize everything. It is kind of lazy. We do not want to see the details. We just want to jump in. We want to have results right away. \"If I do this, I will get a result.\" One, single, straightway like that. It may not happen. Life has ups and downs. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So, if you want to have good results, think about the pieces. And if whatever necessary pieces, causes, and conditions come together, we will have a result. For sure. This is very powerful, actually, if you want to have good results, if you want to be successful in life, or if you want to have a meaningful life. That can apply to your workplace, studies, and meditation also. Everything.\nI have one student whose family has a big shoe company. They have two thousand people, somewhere in Asia, making shoes. And the father was in charge of the company, but he became a little bit too old, and it was not going well. The business was going down, and finally, the father put his son in charge. And the son came to me and asked, \"What should I do?\" And I told him, \"First, you have to see the pieces on a detailed level. Put all the necessary causes and conditions together, and then wait for time.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] He went back to the company and tried to look at all the pieces, and suddenly he saw what was necessary. He put all the pieces together.\nThe result may not come right away. You may have to wait a little bit, but it is really beneficial for your work. And emotionally it is really beneficial. When we have a very strong sense of \"me,\" when it is solid, we become sensitive. As I mentioned before, we easily cry, easily disappear, easily burn, easily melt, and easily freeze — we are seeing ourselves as solid, one, and single. But when we see the pieces, it is really beneficial.&nbsp;\nI will do the meditation on this in the next teaching.\nThank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that we have the tendency to view ourselves, others, and phenomena as solid and singular. He shares a story about a shoe factory owner who applies the wisdom of seeing many different causes and conditions in the management of his business, ultimately leading to success. Why is it important to see multiple layers and conditions in phenomena and the sense of self? Please explain.\nPoints to remember:\nThe three aspects of the healthy sense of self are multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence.\nWhen we see things as they are, we discover that a seemingly single entity can be broken down into many different components or parts.\nEverything, even problems, can be an opportunity to connect with wisdom.\nInquiry\nIs how you are viewing yourself in this moment who you truly are?\nIn this reading, you will learn about:\nthe role of recognizing phenomena as they are\nhow problems can become opportunities Joyful Wisdom, pp. 239-241 &nbsp;(Ch. 11, \"Breaking It Down\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.2 Wisdom of Multiplicity Meditation\" data-href=\"3.2.2 Wisdom of Multiplicity Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.2 Wisdom Of Multiplicity, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.2 wisdom of multiplicity, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.2 View","shoe company story"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (11 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(11_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Wisdom of Multiplicity: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Wisdom_of_Multiplicity_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.2-wisdom-of-multiplicity-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475797,"modifiedTime":1759272587502,"sourceSize":8461,"sourcePath":"1.

Maybe in the morning, when you begin to do your work or whatever you do in the day, try to set the intention, and see whether you are relating to the unhealthy or healthy sense of self. You do not need to judge. Just bring awareness to it.\nThen, in your life, maybe you will see a person and notice how some of the time you immediately try to separate yourself from others. \"I do not like that person because that person talks more than me,\" or \"I do not like that person because that person does not believe what I believe.\" Or maybe, \"I do not like that person because that person is taller than me.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It might be there in the subconscious mind, you know? \"I do not like that person because of their skin color. I do not like that person because of their cultural beliefs. I do not like that person because they might have different behavior.\" This is constantly within us. We just bring awareness to it.\nAnd when we bring awareness to it, we see that actually everybody has unique things. And all these unique things are related to each other. Soil is different from water, water is different from heat, heat is different from oxygen, and oxygen is different from seeds. But when these unique things are related to each other and work together, then there will be a result, right? There will be an apple.\nIt is the same thing here. We all have uniqueness. But these unique things have to relate to each other. Maybe you will see how you and others are interconnected. And through that, we all help each other. We all have to work together. And with these unique or special things, everybody has different talents, skills, qualities, capacities, and resources. There are a lot of different things. But we all work together, interdependently. So, understand others and listen to others.\nYou can try all these different practices in your life. And especially when you have a strong emotion coming, see why you are upset and why you do not like something. Because it is out of your control, right? It is not in your hands. See that aspect — why you are upset. \"Why is it 'me, me me' now?\" Explore all these things. These exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nIn the morning, set the intention to notice the interdependence of people you encounter five times during the day. If you have a particular plan for the day, such as having a meeting at work, going grocery shopping, or visiting a friend, imagine clearly in your mind when you would like to apply this practice. The moment we see people, we are quick to judge and categorize them, placing them into the \"like\" or \"dislike\" group. In this case, the practice is to see the interdependence and connections you have with people, particularly in regard to their different skills, qualities, capacities, or backgrounds.&nbsp;\nIn the evening, rejoice if you remembered to apply the practice during the day. If you forgot, reaffirm your aspiration to integrate the practice with your activities tomorrow.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nAs you recognize how we are all interdependent, does this help you uproot the belief that we are different and divided?&nbsp;\nWhich situations and/or groups of people do you find it easy to connect with? Which ones are difficult? Why is it easier to connect with certain groups and harder to connect with others? Please explain.\nTip\nAppreciate the next person you see today, and recognize that everyone has unique qualities, skills, and capacities.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.3 Interdependence and Self Summary\" data-href=\"3.2.3 Interdependence and Self Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.3 Interdependence And Self, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.3 interdependence and self, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.3 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Interdependence and Self: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Interdependence_and_Self_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475787,"modifiedTime":1759272587514,"sourceSize":4542,"sourcePath":"1.

Having worked with singularity and multiplicity in the first two sections, we will now dive into the next characteristic, namely that of interdependence.\nAs with the other characteristics, there is a lot to be said here, but I believe one of the key points, and one that has been important in my own life, is this sense of \"us versus them\" or \"me versus you.\" We are completely missing how we are all actually interconnected. Even if we are not aware of interdependence as such, just how we are placing our focus changes the whole narrative for how we are viewing ourselves and others. What I want to say here is that we can choose to focus on what is separating us, or we can choose to focus on what brings us together and what we have in common. For example, I can choose to focus on myself and another man as belonging to different political parties, and therefore being so-called enemies. Or I can choose to focus on us being fathers and how we both care for our children and feel the same wish of wanting them to be happy or wanting the best for them. And when it comes to belonging to different religions or belief systems, often there seems to be a focus on what separates these traditions instead of looking at all the things that they have in common.&nbsp;\nOf course, we do not have to go as far as to say it is all the same. In fact, I personally believe that is not the most helpful approach. But rather, I believe that there is something much greater or grander in being able to say, \"It is not the same, and it is okay.\" In fact, it might actually be a good thing that it is not all the same. It also seems so easy to look at what others are doing wrong or criticize others' anger or hatred, but it seems harder to look at our own. And I heard this great quote — I cannot remember from whom — but the message has really stuck with me. And it goes something like this: \"There is a reason why there is so much anger in the world, because if one stopped hating, one would have to look at one's own pain, and that is just too difficult.\"&nbsp;\nI would like to end by telling a story that I heard about fifteen years ago that I think illustrates interdependence nicely. It is about a rabbi in the Jewish tradition asking his students a question. In the Jewish tradition, certain prayers are to be carried out at specific times of the day, or at least so I am told, with one of these times being in the morning when night turns to day. The rabbi asks his students, \"When exactly is this time?\" And the first student answers, \"Is it when you can look at a tree at some distance and determine whether it is a pear or a fig tree?\" And the rabbi says, \"No, that is not it.\" Then the second student says, \"Is it when you can look at the palm of your hand and detect its lines?\" And the rabbi again says, \"No, that is also wrong.\" Then the third student says, \"Is it when you can look at an animal at a distance and determine whether it is a sheep or a dog?\" And the rabbi again says, \"No, that is not it.\" So then the students ask, \"So, when is it?\" The rabbi looks at them, and he says, \"It is when you can look every man or woman in the eyes and see that they are your brother or sister. Until then it is still night.\"\nWith that, I wish you all the best in your practice, and I am looking forward to connecting with you in the forums. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.3 Interdependence and Self View\" data-href=\"3.2.3 Interdependence and Self View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.3 Interdependence And Self, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.3 interdependence and self, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Interdependence and Self (4 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Interdependence_and_Self_(4_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475774,"modifiedTime":1759272587519,"sourceSize":4037,"sourcePath":"1.

Just relax and loosely observe it. And if you do not have this feeling, do not create it. If you cannot see it, let it be that way. Basically, just keep in mind that you want to see the independent sense of self.\nWith the independent sense of self, you might have a sense of not seeing the connection between yourself and others. There is some kind of self-image of your side or group being kind of better. There is a sense of looking a little bit down on others' ideas and groups. You might have biases. You may not see the biases that keep you from seeing the connection between yourself and others.&nbsp;\nOn the subtle level, there is a want to control and be totally independent. There is a sense of wanting to control your life, situations, friends, family, or whatever. Of course, we try to make things work, see all the pieces, and understand that we all are related and interdependent. We make an effort and try to have a result. That is totally fine — that is not really controlling.\nHere, \"controlling\" means that you do not see the pieces, and you do not see the connections. Normally what happens is that, based on ignorance, hatred, selfishness, and self-centeredness, you try to manage and control your life. We need to be aware of this. When we bring awareness to this, it is the beginning of liberation, the beginning of freedom.&nbsp;\nWe will do this practice together. So, please keep your spine loosely straight, and first rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nWhether you ask a question or just look at the feeling of the sense of self, try to see whether there is an independent self or not. A self-centric feeling may be more related to hatred or desire — you want to win and others have to lose. Maybe you have your own political party, or you have your own idea about your colleagues, friends, boss, people who work for you, and your family. You try to divide between favorites and non-favorites.\n[Silent meditation]\nOn an emotional level, you want to control everything, and when you cannot control something, you might experience hatred, panic, depression, or sadness. A lot of things can come up. Just be aware of them. You do not need to judge them. We are not saying that they are bad. Right now, if you just see them, that is okay.&nbsp;\nEverybody makes mistakes. So, forgive yourself, but do not give up. Do not give up on yourself. Do not give up on trying to see your connection to others. When you see the connection between yourself and others, there is love and compassion that arises automatically.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. Thank you! 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice\nWe will explore the practice of interdependence in three steps, looking first at independence, second at interdependence, and last at our own lives from this new perspective.\nBegin session Take a moment to find a comfortable posture that helps you feel both awake and alert, but most importantly at ease and relaxed. Close your eyes if you find it helpful.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice how your body feels.\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest naturally.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice your sense of self in this moment. In particular, notice how, from the perspective linked with the unhealthy sense of self, you feel as though you are somewhat cut off from what you experience. Is there a sense of self which is somehow different and separate from everything that it experiences? See if you can step back and notice a solid sense of self.&nbsp;\nNow, notice what you are hearing. Notice how there is a sense that you are separate from the sounds that you hear. You are here, and the sounds and what is making the sounds are somewhere else. They seem separate. Simply notice the sense of self that is experienced as independent or separate.\nNow, notice the feelings in your body and how there is a sense of being within a boundary — a separateness between you and the rest of the world. You do not need to do or to change anything. Simply notice that there is this sense of separateness between you and everything else.&nbsp;\nNext, notice any words, images, or thoughts in your mind. Then, see if you can feel a sense of that which is observing the thoughts. There is the observer and something being observed, as if these were two separate things. Simply notice this sense of division, independence, and separateness.&nbsp;\nDrop what you are doing, and rest in open, effortless awareness. Let go of the mental effort, and simply be.\nNow, reflect on all of the different causes, conditions, and circumstances that are coming together to allow the experience of hearing to happen. Notice the fact that you can hear, that sounds are occurring, that you have consciousness and awareness, and how all these factors need to be present to allow this experience to unfold. Explore how the one hearing and the sounds that are being heard cannot be separated from all of these different factors. Simply notice the rich interplay of experience, and rest in the sense of connectedness.&nbsp;\nDrop what you are doing, and rest in open, effortless awareness.&nbsp;\nNext, step back and examine your life from this new perspective of interdependence. You can use anything in your life as the basis for this exploration. You might explore the very fact that you are meditating right now. Contemplate the many factors, steps, and conditions that might have led up to this moment of you meditating.&nbsp;\nNow, explore this further by thinking of the different people who have made this moment possible, like Mingyur Rinpoche, as a teacher, and people who have helped you become interested in meditation in the first place. Again, the point of this exploration is not to judge or evaluate, but simply to see how you are shaped by all these connections and circumstances.&nbsp;\nNow, step back, and examine the inner circumstances which have led to this moment. Simply notice your own inspiration, interest, and desire to discover yourself and how these factors and circumstances within you led to this moment.\nIn the end, let go of the exploration, and simply rest naturally in the flow of the experience, which includes all of these different circumstances and factors in your life that have come together to shape each passing moment. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End session Slowly open your eyes. Take a moment to look around, and notice some of the small details of the world around you.&nbsp;\nLet go, and simply rest in open awareness.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. We often have the belief that we are independent beings. Mingyur Rinpoche explains that our conditioned belief manifests on the subtle level as an attempt to control everything.

Every identification of any one form has meaning only in relationship to another.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe unhealthy and healthy sense of self through the aspect of interdependence\nhow we rely on each other to survive\nthe downfalls of being caught up with the unhealthy sense of self\nthe benefits of seeing how every experience is related to a variety of factors\nWatch Read\nNow, we will focus more on interdependence and independence. What we call the \"unhealthy sense of self\" is independent, and the \"healthy sense of self\" is interdependent.\nWith the unhealthy — independence — we do not see how we are related to each other, and we try to create a strong separation and independence from others. Sometimes, in fact, we try to harm or make obstacles for others. What actually happens is that we harm ourselves because others are part of us, we cannot be complete without others.\nFor example, if you come into this world and nobody is there, if you are all alone you cannot survive. Now you are here because of others. You have had help from your parents, family, and friends. Maybe in school, there were caretakers and there were teachers. And in our lives right now, through food, clothes, money, education, ideas, and everything, we are related to each other. But what happens in the world is that we do not see that we are interdependent, and we try to really make \"me and them\" separate.\nAt the subtle level, in our mind, there is some kind of feeling of independence. We have a feeling of wanting to do everything by ourselves, with no need to depend on anything else. We try to control everything. As soon as you meet a new person, you try to see what that person does and how that person talks and behaves. You are calculating, and once you know these things you can control that person. We want to control everything. We want to control situations, we want to control our future, job, and everything, so there is a sense of everything being in our hands. There is no need to depend on others; you have to control everything by yourself.\nOr sometimes, this may become the opposite: you cannot really control everything, you may feel like everything is confusing and out of control. You have a sense of wanting to control everything and wanting to have the past, present, and future in your hands. That makes the self become really sensitive.\nIf everything ends up being out of your control, not under your control, you feel upset, depressed, and lonely. Much of the time, we feel lonely, we feel sad, and a lot of strong negative emotion comes.\nThis also affects relationships between people in your family. You all are interdependent, but you want to control things in the family. Actually, this becomes a big problem. You do not want to lose face, you do not want to listen to others, and you do not want to see others' perspectives. That is not only true with your family but also in social situations, in connections to your friends, at your workplace, and, at a bigger level, around the world.\nRight now, we have the Covid-19 pandemic. If we do not try to work together and think we can do everything by ourselves, it does not work, because we all are related to each other. If one country is affected, soon other countries will also be affected. Right now, everyone around the world is affected because of interdependence. We are all somehow related to each other.\nAlso, people talk about their different colors, but actually, we all have genes from different places. I heard that there is research about how we all have genes with different percentages from different places. Maybe I have some part from the Middle East, or maybe from Africa, maybe from America, maybe from Native Indians — who knows? We all are kind of related.\nIn a way, we all are like relatives, a big family. We all are part of one big family. But we do not see that. What we see is that our skin colors are a little bit different, and then we do not try, we do not get along with each other. Or we might have little differences in our language, behavior, and beliefs, so we try to mark this difference. \"My way is superior, and I do not like them.\" This is a sense of independence. But if you can look at it as being unique, that is totally fine. You have unique things, they have unique things, and if these different unique things work together, that is good. Wonderful! There is still interdependence, right?\nBut if you try to cut off others and just be by yourself, that is the problem. Socially, you will have problems. Emotionally, you will have problems, and around culture. Whether on the bigger level of the entire world, or the small level in one family, it will bring problems. Even on a very small level, in your mind, it is a cause of suffering.\nOkay. We need to understand what the unhealthy sense of self is, and just bringing awareness to that unhealthy sense of self is wisdom. Remember? It does not mean that if you have this unhealthy sense of self of independence that you are bad. Everybody has it. But the important thing is that if you do not see it and are attached to it, if you are lost in that, that will eventually become a problem. But, of course, you cannot really get rid of it, in the beginning. Just be aware of it.\nAs I often tell you, there is truth in it. Our true nature, our luminous self, who we really are, has a quality of independence and also interdependence. But if you look at only one aspect, that is the problem. If you see an elephant as only a fan, that is a problem, isn't it? But if you see that an elephant has a fan-like feature — its ears look like a fan — that is okay.\nTo understand this is the view.&nbsp;\nThank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWe typically have the belief that we are independent beings. Moreover, Mingyur Rinpoche explains that this conditioned belief manifests on the subtle level as an attempt to control everything. Do you see examples in your life in which this is true? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that nobody can survive without other people or circumstances. What do you think is the significance of this interdependent nature of self and phenomena? Points to remember:\nThe unhealthy sense of self is grasping at independence, and the healthy sense of self is recognizing interdependence.\nYou can broaden your perspective in challenging circumstances by recognizing the variety of factors, aspects, and pieces involved.\nYou are able to live the life you do because of a variety of factors and circumstances.\nBy harming or creating obstacles for others, you actually harm yourself.\nYou suffer because you identify as a singular self.\nInquiry\nDoes your role shift depending on who you are with or what circumstances you are in?\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout how we define who we are in a limited way\na Buddhist perspective of how everything emerges from a multitude of causes and conditions Joyful Wisdom, pp. 111–114 (Ch. 5, \"Independence\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.3 Interdependence and Self Meditation\" data-href=\"3.2.3 Interdependence and Self Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.3 Interdependence And Self, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.3 interdependence and self, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Interdependence and Self: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Interdependence_and_Self_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.3-interdependence-and-self-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475765,"modifiedTime":1759272587541,"sourceSize":7943,"sourcePath":"1.

For example, if you are having coffee in a cup, people make the cup. Maybe you have to make the coffee from a coffee machine. Or you need to buy it in a cafe. Think about where this coffee comes from, and the people who have made it possible for you to have the coffee that you are drinking right now. Appreciate this. It is really wonderful. There are so many things there to appreciate and feel gratitude for.\nIf you are in the car, how many causes and conditions are needed to make the car, the roads, the trains, and the buildings?\nOr cloth. To make this cloth, so many causes and conditions come together.\nAnd also, on the emotional level, if you have destructive emotions or suffering, see how all of the pieces in your mind are related — the sensations, beliefs, words, and images. When you see all of these pieces and how they are related, they do not become solid, like a rock. They are not solid and single anymore. Then, it is almost as if you see bubbles of many different things, rather than seeing them as rocks.\nOr clouds. When you are in an airplane and look down, clouds look so solid. They look like rocks down there. But when you are in the clouds, there are a lot of spaces, aren't there? They are soft, with a lot of empty space in between, and all are related.\nThis helps us to develop love and compassion and to understand others better as well. When you understand others better, there is less fear. It is like the distance between you and others dissolves. You also do not feel lonely. You feel more connected to everybody.\nTry this in your life.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nAt the beginning of each day, take a moment to set the intention to recognize the interdependence between you and everything else in the world. Set the intention to focus on certain aspects, such as roadways, buildings, clothes, foods, water, air, etc. Throughout the day, pause and recognize how every aspect of life is interconnected.&nbsp;\nYou can recognize the interdependent nature of you and others in your life. At the beginning of each day, take a moment to set the intention to recognize the interdependence between you and your friends, family members, neutral people, or people whom you do not like.

In this section, we are going to be looking at the wisdom of interdependence, continuing to do this exploration of self of all phenomena and looking towards the aspect of how everything is interdependent. Everything is living in relationship with everything else.\nAs we begin to really see all of these multiple components of self, we start to see how all of these components are influenced and based in aspects that are connected to other aspects within our bodies, that are connected to our upbringing, that are connected to the world we live in and the perceptions of others. It all can have an effect. And so we begin to see that we really are all in this together, in what can be a very beautiful way. There is something about seeing that we are not living in some independent state that we have to hold on to, protect, or be fearful about, but that the world is much more malleable and pliable. When our minds are not locked into preserving some sense of an \"independent me,\" it is so much more fluid.&nbsp;\nAnd so this is the exploration Rinpoche is going to take us on. We will just be looking more deeply. And with this, interdependence is such a good one to be looking at in our daily lives. So I encourage you to really watch that you are not just practicing these practices on the cushion, but that you are actually taking them into life. In any moment, you can tap into the wisdom of interdependence. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.4 Wisdom of Interdependence View\" data-href=\"3.2.4 Wisdom of Interdependence View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.4-wisdom-of-interdependence-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.4 Wisdom Of Interdependence, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.4 wisdom of interdependence, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Wisdom of Interdependence (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Wisdom_of_Interdependence_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.4-wisdom-of-interdependence-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.4-wisdom-of-interdependence-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475751,"modifiedTime":1759272587560,"sourceSize":2094,"sourcePath":"1.

To see one in all and all in one is to break through the great barrier which narrows one's perception of reality.\"\n— Thich Nhat Hanh\nWatch Read\nIn meditation, you need to see the relationship between yourself and others, and even within yourself, how the pieces are related. For example, if you are now having a cup of vegetable soup on your table, maybe that vegetable soup was cooked by the chefs in the kitchen. And before they cooked it, they needed to buy ingredients in the grocery store. And in the grocery store, there are so many people — the cashiers, and the people who have brought the vegetables into the grocery store and put them on the shelves. And then, the people who have brought the vegetables to the store have bought them from farmers. And what do the farmers have to do? They have to plant the seeds on the farm and grow them. And in order to grow them, there are many pieces, as I mentioned before: soil, moisture, temperature, oxygen, care, fertilizer, time, and so many things. And each of them has other sub-pieces, and they are all related to each other. So now, you see the vegetable soup in your cup. We practice seeing how all this is interdependent. In the same way, in your body right now everything is interdependent; in your mind, all the emotions are seen as interdependent.\nWe will do this meditation together. Please keep your spine loosely straight, and rest your mind in open awareness first.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please be aware of whatever concepts you have. It could be the unhealthy sense of self or healthy sense of self. Do not judge. And there is no need to control it.\nWhen you look at the self, normally what you will find is that the pieces are connected, they are interdependent. The self has many different aspects. The self, as you see it now, is because of your job title, your position in your workplace, manager or staff. Or your profession — being a doctor, nurse, or lawyer. Or being a husband, wife, child, or parent. Or how other people perceive you. Or, right now, the self has a body and mind together. And then there is just the idea of the self, the feeling of the self, that depends on the body and the mind.\nIf you are having an emotion — let's say depression, hatred, anxiety, stress, or low self-esteem — that emotion has a lot of pieces, so you see that. There are sensations in the body. There are images, voices, and beliefs, and all of these are interdependent. Let's say there is no image, then it is very difficult to have that emotion. Let's use hatred. You hate somebody, you hate yourself, or you hate someone you do not like. There is an image. If there is no object of that, there will be no hatred. Or there is a sensation in the body, like a burning fire. If there is no sensation, there is no hatred. Or words and beliefs. If all of these are related to each other, then there is hatred. You cannot find hatred apart from images, voices, beliefs, or sensations.\nWhen you really see this interdependent connection, the power of the negative emotions begins to calm down. Although it might not disappear right away, it is okay. You see more of the truth. You see more about the way these things are, their true nature.\nNow, please rest your mind in open awareness again. Just be as it is.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 7 days of practice Begin session Begin by finding a comfortable body posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease and relaxation.\nBe aware of sensations in your body.\nRest in open awareness while keeping all sense doors open. There is nothing to do. Simply be.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp; Main practice Look directly at the sense of self, and be aware of whatever comes up in your experience. It may be the sense of your body or what is connected to it. Your body did not suddenly appear from nowhere. Reflect on the different factors that support your body, like the food you eat, the water you bathe in, and the air you breathe. &nbsp; &nbsp;\nReflect on how this is not only true for this moment, but how your body has depended on other factors your whole life.\nNext, look at the immediacy of this moment. Contemplate how your body is affected by the temperature in the room, the quality of the air that you breathe, the clothing you wear, the food you eat, and the injuries that you have had in the past. &nbsp;\nNow, whatever the sense of self is, look at the interdependence of the different pieces that make it up. Ask yourself, \"Is there anything that is independent? Is there anything that is not connected to something else?\" Then, rest and let your experience be as it is. If there are moments of the gap or space between these phenomena, simply be aware of it.&nbsp;\nYou can stay with the analysis as long as you prefer. Let the play of interdependence reveal itself through inquiry with awareness.&nbsp; End session Let go of any inquiries, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone.

Your perceptions are only crude approximations of the true nature of things.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe significance of looking at the sense of self in the practice of awakening wisdom\nanother aspect of the sense of self\nrelationships between you and others\nscientific perspectives on interdependence\nWatch Read\nWhen you look at the self, maybe you wonder why always looking at the self is important? Who is feeling happy, who is feeling sad, who is feeling emotionally disturbed, and who has wisdom, love, and compassion? It is the self, isn't it? We have a self. We are not saying that we should not feel the sense of self. We can feel the sense of self, but how the self is, what the self is, is very important. Seeing the true nature of the self is really important. Wisdom really comes from understanding the nature of self. When we understand the nature of self, that is the real beginning of freedom, happiness, and liberation. You can understand multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence with a table, tree, or any phenomenon. That is totally okay. But to really free ourselves will take longer. If you want to free yourself, focus on the self. Because the self is the root of everything for you. Yes. Now, another aspect. First, what you see when you look at the self are pieces. Here, when you look at the self, you might see different aspects. There are five possible experiences: First, pieces. Second, aspects. Third, changes. Fourth, you cannot see it. Fifth, the unhealthy sense of self might seem stronger. Whatever it is is okay. You might experience these. As we go deeper into these — we have the first, second, third, etc., step by step — that does not mean you should not see the pieces here. You can see pieces, you can see changes, but my focus here is more on the interdependent aspect. When you look at the self, maybe you will see interdependence. The self has different aspects. Maybe Mingyur Rinpoche, because of his students, is a teacher. Because of my teacher, I am a student. Because of your parents, you are a child. If you have kids, you are a parent. Because of your friends, you are a friend. In your office, maybe you are a boss because of having staff. Or you have a boss and you are one of the staff. Or you are a husband because of your wife, or you are a wife because of your husband. The self has many different aspects. And also, when you think about the self, immediately you think about what \"my mom told me\" or \"my father told me when I was young.\" Or what \"my friend told me about me.\" \"Oh, you are a good person. My friend says you are a good person.\" Or, \"Maybe you are not so good, somebody told me.\" So this is looking at it from another aspect. Actually, when we look at the self, what we find is all these different aspects, the interdependence. If you see this, this is wonderful. Then you also see that self and other are related. \"Other\" is a part of you. From there, you will see connections, eventually. Even in the case of a person whom you do not like, the real difference between you and that person is not big. That person wants to be happy and does not want to suffer. That person also has a body, mind, mental processes, beliefs, cultural influences, and so many things that are very similar to yours. Of course, that person has awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom — no matter who they are. On a fundamental level, that person is good. We talked about this in level two. Seeing the interconnectedness between you and others really helps to develop love and compassion. Not knowing interdependence, the self, the ego-clinging [Mingyur Rinpoche holds up a clenched fist], is the real enemy. There is no real, single entity you can find that is totally independent. Nowadays, we are all related, the entire world. Sometimes I have discussions with scientists — physicists, neurologists, social scientists, etc. In the past, what they looked for was the one answer for everything, or one solution for everything, one idea of everything. Or with the brain, one area of control: Where is its location? What is it exactly? They were looking for independence. But now, they see that everything is related to everything. The first time that I went to a laboratory was at the University of Wisconsin in 2002. At that time, the emotions were believed to be located in different parts of the brain. They talked about the different, clear locations. Now they say that all parts of the brain are interconnected. Also, in developmental psychology, at first, they held a different view, but now they see that everything is related. In physics, also, everything is interdependent. The way you calculate, mathematics, is based on seeing that everything is related. When we see that everything is related, we also feel that we are becoming bigger and freer. At the same time, you will have more creativity. You see how the uniqueness of things and each individual's uniqueness work together. How all these pieces work together — the dance between the pieces. That is who we are now. Thank you!\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that when we look at the sense of self, we find that the so-called self is interconnected with many aspects, people, and circumstances. How might you explain this to a friend? Question 2\nIf you doubt this teaching on interdependence, what counterargument might you use? Question 3\nMingyur Rinpoche illustrates the interdependence of phenomena with a variety of examples from physics, neuroscience, psychology, etc. Can you think of other scientific examples that you have encountered or learned before? Points to remember:\nYou are interdependent with others.\nEverything is interconnected.\nWith the view of interdependence, you become more free and creative.\nThere are five experiences when meditating on the sense of self: pieces (i.e. multiplicity)\naspects (i.e. interdependence)\nchange (i.e. impermanence)\nbeing unable to see/experience/feel&nbsp;\nthe sense of self growing stronger Tip\nView moments of experiencing strong emotions during the day as opportunities to reflect on interdependence.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout great examples that illustrate the way things are from the perspective of interdependence\nhow perception is understood from a neuroscientific perspective\nabout an experiment which explores how subjects' backgrounds affect perception The Joy of Living, pp. 76-80 (Ch.5, &nbsp;Start at the beginning of the chapter&nbsp;\"The Relativity of Perception\"&nbsp;and end before&nbsp;\"Subjects and Objects: A Neuroscientific View.\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.2.4 Wisdom of Interdependence Meditation\" data-href=\"3.2.4 Wisdom of Interdependence Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.4-wisdom-of-interdependence-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.2.4 Wisdom Of Interdependence, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.2.4 wisdom of interdependence, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.2.4 View","the five experiences of self","why looking at the self is important","why do we look at the self"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Wisdom of Interdependence: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Wisdom_of_Interdependence_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.4-wisdom-of-interdependence-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.2/3.2.4-wisdom-of-interdependence-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475727,"modifiedTime":1759272587583,"sourceSize":7770,"sourcePath":"1.

Now, we have finished this course. Until now, what we have done is be with the self, look at the self, feel the self, or observe the self. It depends on your personality. Or maybe you described the self. If you have a \"body personality,\" observing feels good for you. If you have a \"speech personality,\" looking or describing the self might be better for you. If you have a \"mind personality,\" feeling the self or sensing the self might be better for you. It does not matter which way.\nWhen you do that, there are two ways, right? One is with resting meditation, and the other is by analyzing with analytical meditation. When you do that, what happens? Maybe you can feel the self. Maybe you can find the self. If you feel the self, that means the sense of self becomes an object of awareness. And you are not controlling, suppressing, or changing it. That is kindness. Even if the self feels as if it is not good, allow that. Even if you have an unhealthy sense of self, allow that. That is forgiveness, being kind to yourself, and compassionate also. And the self becomes the object of your meditation. Who is looking at the self? There is another self, much bigger, although you cannot really see it.\nAnd remember that, like in level one, when you see the river you are out of the river, right? Vertical liberation happens. Wonderful! Even if the unhealthy sense of self becomes stronger, that is okay. If it is too strong, then try something different, take a step back, or take a break. You have known about these options since level one, right? Try these four: watch, and if the unhealthy sense of self becomes too strong and overwhelming, try something different, take a step back, or take a break.\nNow, with the second experience, what do you experience? If you cannot see the sense of self, great! That is nonconceptual. There is a gap. That is horizontal liberation — the gap. That is also a good experience — a nonconceptual experience or selfless experience. If sometimes you feel a little fear, do not worry about it. That is also good.\nOr for some of you, when you look at the self, or when you are with the self, there are thoughts, images, and sensations. Your body, mind, name, and so many different pieces come. Great! That is multiplicity. Wonderful. That is true. That is the third experience.\nThe fourth experience is that some of you see different aspects of the self. \"My name.\" \"I am a son,\" \"I am a daughter,\" or \"I am a father.\" So it is in relation to others. \"Because of my job, my title, my position.\" Or, \"Oh, the self, yeah. I am good because my friend told me I am good.\" \"My parents told me I am good.\" Or, \"My colleague told me I am not so good.\" That is interdependence. That is also good! You see that the self cannot exist by itself.\nOr, the last experience is that you see the self is changing. Sometimes it is a good self, sometimes not such a good self, sometimes a happy self, sometimes not such a happy self. It is changing and changing. You see impermanence.\nSo, if you see pieces, wonderful! Different perspectives — if you see that, wonderful! On the relative level that is true. That it is always changing is also true. All of these are good.\nWe are done with that now, and we have finished this course. In the next course, we really want to explore the essence, the core, the self beyond self, or the luminous self. That is really who you are, your fundamental nature, original purity, your basic innate goodness.\nThat we will explore later. Thank you! Conclusion by Kasumi Kato Read\nHi, everyone. This is the end of this course. Congratulations! You have now learned the three principles — multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence — and the relative truth of the unhealthy and healthy sense of self.\nThis course was unique in that we are encouraged to apply the three principles to the very things that trouble us. In my own experience, it was so difficult to apply them, even though I had the intention to do so. One of the things that helped me over time was to develop patience and warmth towards myself. It is totally okay to make mistakes, and we can be resilient by learning from them. Another is to go back to a compassionate motivation. It is also helpful to really ask ourselves, just like Mingyur Rinpoche asked himself during the beginning of his three-year retreat, \"Do I really want to stay in this habitual pattern?\" The answer is always no.\nI really encourage you to consider this a long journey. We are cultivating a skill in a slow, steady, step-by-step manner. In the next course, you will go even deeper into the exploration of who you truly are. Now that you are familiar with the healthy sense of self, it is time to learn about the self beyond self.\nThank you so much for sharing your insight and questions in the forum and webinars. I truly enjoyed deepening our practices together. I hope to see you again in the future. Best wishes for your journey. Conclusion by Antonia Sumbundu Read\nHello, everyone. Congratulations! You have now completed this course and had the opportunity to explore impermanence and also explore how we can transform the different emotions and experiences that we have in our life into wisdom.\nIn this course, we have been going over quite a bit of material, and you probably feel that this is something we could continue doing for a very long time and that we would still be discovering new things and learning. I really encourage you to at times return to some of this and to also explore some of the practices over a longer period of time if this is something that is inspiring and of interest to you. This whole journey of moving from the unhealthy sense of self, where we usually live our lives, towards the healthy sense of self, where we really see all our qualities and where we are in accordance with the way things are — that is a journey that is so beautiful and that we can continue.\nAnd as you know, this is not the end of the journey. We have more courses and more practices coming up for you. So I look forward to meeting you again and also encourage you to continue this journey if at times you find that it is challenging or that you have reached a plateau. Just remember that that is how learning is. Sometimes we have a sense of growing, of expansion, and sometimes we may have a sense of things being on a plateau, and it is all part of the terrain.\nSo a big congratulations to you, and see you again later. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4 the Self Beyond Self\" data-href=\"3.4 the Self Beyond Self\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4-the-self-beyond-self.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Go to Next Course →</a>","aliases":["3.3 Impermanence And Transformation, Conclusion - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3 impermanence and transformation, conclusion - Tergar joy of living course","3.3 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_(10_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4-the-self-beyond-self.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3-impermanence-and-transformation-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476119,"modifiedTime":1759272587600,"sourceSize":7635,"sourcePath":"1.

Now, we are going to explore the unhealthy and healthy sense of self more. This will be the last principle. There are three principles. We have the unhealthy and healthy sense of self with multiplicity, interdependence, and here, with impermanence. Impermanence is normally really important in the whole meditative lineage of Tibet and in general for all buddhadharma. Impermanence is a really important topic.\nNormally, we have two kinds of meditation: shamatha and vipashyana. Level one is shamatha, and now, in level three, it is vipashyana. The main important point of vipashyana is impermanence. Sometimes we say, \"Knowing impermanence is wisdom.\"\nAlthough impermanence, in my tradition, is still on the relative level, it is the true relative, not the fake relative. Permanence is fake, but this is the true relative. This is a stepping stone to emptiness. Emptiness is our third sense of self: the self beyond self or luminous self. So this impermanence practice is really important.&nbsp;\nThen, we will have particular teachings about how to transform using all these three views of multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence. We will look at how to transform experiences in our lives, especially suffering and destructive emotions.\nYou will learn all of this in this course, and, hopefully, you will enjoy it.\nWelcome from Kasumi Kato Read\nWelcome to the course Awakening Wisdom. I am happy that you are in this course. I am Kasumi, and along with Antonia, I will be guiding you through the third course, Impermanence and Transformation.\nIn this program, Awakening Wisdom, you all have been exploring why we suffer — particularly, seeing clearly that our habitual patterns keep us from seeing who we truly are. We also have been exploring the sense of self, including the unhealthy and healthy sense of self, and two of the three principles: multiplicity and interdependence.&nbsp;\nIn this course, Impermanence and Transformation, Mingyur Rinpoche will teach about the third principle, impermanence. Rinpoche also offers us strategies to apply the three principles in order to transform destructive emotions and suffering.\nThese teachings, over the years, have transformed my life. In a way, I was given one of the best tools to see my fixations and assumptions in life clearly. When I remember to simply see my fixations and misperceptions, the solid sense of self, or the notion of \"I,\" softens. And I have a bit more acceptance, equanimity, and joy in my life.&nbsp;\nWhat I have found really helpful is to revisit and explore how, over the years, we have developed a particular way of operating in this world that really does not serve us anymore.&nbsp;\nI really hope that you enjoy this course, Impermanence and Transformation. I myself will be practicing these meditations as a fellow practitioner. I look forward to hearing from you in our forum and webinars. Welcome from Antonia Sumbundu Read\nHello, everyone! This is Antonia. I am very happy to be able to join you again, here in this third course in Awakening Wisdom. And in this course, I will be your guide together with Kasumi, and we will be doing our best to support you as we continue the journey of awakening wisdom and exploring some of the basic beliefs and assumptions that we may be living our life by. In the previous course, you had a thorough exploration and looked at two of the three basic assumptions or beliefs that are particularly important if we are interested in happiness, if we are interested in ease of being. And these are, as you know, multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence. In this course, we will be looking more closely at impermanence and also begin practicing with it. Impermanence is something that is really easy to understand intellectually. But when it comes to really letting it be an understanding that is embodied, to letting it be an understanding that is something that we live our life from and in accordance with, then we may see that it takes some practice and that it is not so easy. And impermanence is really considered one of the single most transformative and important contemplations that we can do on the path of meditation. Impermanence is something that I have been hearing my teachers over the years come back to again and again, and they have really stressed that, until we start to not just understand impermanence but really live our life in accordance with it, we will still be struggling. And over the years I have come to understand a little bit more why it is considered so important. And I really look forward to engaging in these teachings and practices together with you. As you know, we will be here for you, to support you if you have questions that come up along the way, so you are very welcome to use the forum to ask your questions. But, also, we really encourage you to share your experience and just appreciate the richness of shared experience and how we can learn from each other. We learn so much by articulating our own experience, articulating our understanding, and also articulating what it is that we observe, what it is that we notice and see as we are practicing. But, also, when we have an opportunity to hear from others, hear their perspective, hear their experience, it really adds to our own understanding. And it is our shared richness. So we look forward to that, and we also look forward to meeting you in some of the forums. See you soon, and have a nice journey.

But we get scared of change, because when we identify with a pattern of behavior, giving it up can feel like death itself.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nIn your daily life, try to see the sense of not wanting to change, not wanting to have new things in your life, wanting to have consistency, and not wanting to have unexpected surprises. Maybe you like birthday gifts, you know? Because they are expected. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] A birthday gift surprise, woohoo! You like it because you expect it. But then there are a lot of unexpected surprises in our life. When these things happen to us, \"Boom!\" Maybe our \"me\" feels like it is burning, freezing, or exploding like a bomb. Try to see that in your life.\nAlso, you can write these things down. Perhaps in your family, you might have a pattern that has become frozen — maybe arguing with your family, with your parents, kids, husband, or wife. Or in your company or workplace. Maybe you argue about something, and then that pattern stays in your body and you always want to argue. And even if you want to stop, you cannot stop. It has become kind of permanent. So if you see that pattern, try to break it. Of course, you cannot break it right away. That is impossible. To suddenly understand this teaching today and break that pattern is difficult. But try it. Just bring awareness first. Just having the idea of bringing awareness really helps.\nOne time a couple came to me, and they both had big problems. The problem was that the husband always wanted to control everything, and the wife was always worried about everything. And they were always arguing, and it became a pattern. Their lives were not happy. They tried to break that habit, but they could not. So then they both asked me to help and said, \"Please, bless both of us to remove this suffering in our life.\" They expected some kind of power that I could give them, and tomorrow, \"Boom!\" No more arguments. Something like that. And I told them, \"I do not have that power. I am sorry.\" They were both a little bit disappointed, but then I told them, \"I can give you some advice.\" And they said, \"Whatever advice that comes from you is okay.\" So I told them, \"Every day, for half an hour, you have to have a positive talk. Try to talk about each other's qualities, and try to appreciate all these things in each other.\" And they both said okay, and they left. About one month later, they came back and said, \"Half an hour is too long.\" They had tried to talk about positive qualities in each other. \"Oh, the first time I met you, you were kind,\" and they would then think, \"but now you are not kind.\" But they could not say that, so they would become quiet and look at their watches. So they said, \"What should we do?\" I told them, \"I will give you a discount. No need for half an hour, just five minutes.\" And they were very happy. \"Five minutes is okay!\" They left, and I did not meet them again for one year. After one year, they came back and said, \"Thank you very much for your advice. It changed our lives.\" I was also surprised, you know? Before, I did not expect it to work out that way. And I asked them, \"What happened?\" And they said that when they discussed the positive things, they actually became aware of more and more positive things within themselves. Then they said, \"Half an hour is not enough!\" They actually changed their lives. Of course, the habit cannot be changed right away, but they brought awareness and accepted each other. And they even gave each other funny names. The husband's name was \"control freak,\" and the wife's name was \"worry freak.\" And sometimes the husband would go out and come back and knock on the door, the wife would open it, and the husband would say, \"The most powerful person in the world has come.\" And she would say, \"The most worried person in the world welcomes you.\"\nTherefore, bring this awareness. Even if you cannot change a habit right away, the light of awareness will slowly transform it.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.\nDaily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the beginning of each day, set the intention to recognize where you resist change, and cultivate the wish to let this resistance go. To work with this intention, choose a specific person or a routine with which this resistance arises — perhaps it is a loved one whom you wish to remain the same, or a pleasant aspect of your work life. When exploring this resistance to change, take time to pause and recognize how you grasp at this idea of consistency and permanence. Are there certain stories or beliefs behind this grasping? If you find this practice challenging to do right now, stay with the intention to someday cultivate this ability.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhile observing how you and the world around you are changing, what response or reactions do you experience? Please explain.\nDoes recognizing resistance to change shift your experience in any way?

In this section, we will explore the self through the lens of permanence.\nTo share a bit about my own experience, when I expect things to be more permanent, I realize how much disappointment or irritation occurs simply due to my expectations and assumptions for reality. This includes a simple change from a sunny day to a storm. As Rinpoche says, knowing or recognizing a sense of self is your wisdom. So, what we can do is bring openness and curiosity, and continue to contemplate this simple question: is my perception, expectation, or assumption in sync with who we really are and the nature of reality?\nIn this section, Rinpoche will illuminate our habitual fixations on permanence. Our investigation, then, begins with seeing our subtle yet pervasive sense of self. In that, we do not need to suppress the unhealthy sense of self or change it in any way, but rather simply know and recognize the sense of self in a step-by-step manner.\nHere, we are cultivating a more wholesome way of being in the world.

We do not need to judge them, and we do not need to control anything. But if you automatically judge and control, and you cannot stop controlling and judging, then look at that judgment. Look at the self that is wanting to control, and then that becomes vertical liberation, again.\nHere, we just see this. You might experience the sense of permanence, the self that does not want to change, that wants to have consistency, be solid, fixed, and stable. Whatever it is, you can look at it. Or maybe you have fear of not wanting to change, fear of losing, or fear of something else because you cannot accept impermanence.\nBasically, we need to learn more about who we are. Maybe I will tell you a story about one of my friend's friends from Malaysia. In 2008, there was a financial crisis in Malaysia, and this person was a stock trader, trading the stock market. Within a few months, he lost everything. He even lost his home. Some of his friends became depressed, some of them even became crazy, and some of them could not function. It was a big problem.\nBut this person was okay. He was able to laugh, and he moved into his friend's home and slept there on the couch. He cooked for his friends and invited them to have tea and parties sometimes. And they were all surprised and asked him, \"How do you feel? Because you lost everything.\" And he said, \"Life is impermanent. I got all this money from the stock market, and now it has gone back into the stock market.\" That is life. He accepted it. Of course, in reality, it is suffering, and there are a lot of problems. But when he accepted it, he felt he still had energy, and he never stopped trying to find a solution. He did not give up. He continued. He had skills and knowledge. Everybody, in their own way, has unique skills, capabilities, and powers — we all have so many things, right? The most important thing is that we should not give up but continue to try. So he tried, and a few years later, he became a millionaire again.\nThat's life. We need to see that we have this feeling of not wanting to change, the feeling of fixation, the sense of \"me,\" or the feeling about \"me\" or anything. Or if you see that you are changing, that is also good. Be with that.\nRemember, the fourth possible experience is that you cannot see anything. Great! That is the gap. It is horizontal liberation. And the fifth possibility is that maybe the permanent sense of self becomes stronger. That is okay. If it is too strong, if the fear becomes too strong, then try something different, take a step back, or take a break. Do those things.\nOkay. Now, let's practice together. Please, keep your spine loosely straight. And rest your mind in open awareness first. Just let your mind be as it is. And by now you know that, in meditation, everything is okay. There is nothing which is wrong or a mistake. As long as you try to be aware of it, it is okay. Or be with it.\nNow, please look at the sense of self, idea of self, or feeling of self. Be with the self. Whether you ask questions or practice the resting style does not matter. Maybe you will see the sense of permanence, fixation, and solidity. Not having room for new ideas. Not wanting to accept anything new. No flexibility.\nAnd there is the fear of change. Insecurity. Whatever feeling that you have — panic, anxiety — just be with that.\nWhen you observe this, when you can be with this idea, concept, or feeling, the awareness is bigger. It is bigger than this concept and feeling.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nWhen you rest in open awareness, even with open awareness there are thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. They will come. So let them come and let them go.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes of formal meditation every day\n150 minutes in total for this section\nA streak of 5 days of practice Begin session Find a comfortable posture that supports you in being upright and relaxed.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, drop all the mental effort, and rest in open awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply be present.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, bring awareness to the sense of self in this moment. This is not something you have to think about too much. Just note whether or not you have a general impression that there is a self which is somehow permanent and enduring across time. Rest with whatever experience you have.&nbsp;\nNow, see if you can be aware of the self on an even more subtle level. Are you the same as the person who sat down to meditate, or the one going to bed later today? Reflect on the implicit assumptions that you have about yourself.&nbsp;\nNow, bring your mind to a particular aspect of your body, such as your breath or physical sensations. Examine how there is an assumption or belief that they should be consistent and the same as yesterday. You do not need to do or change anything. Simply notice that there is a sense of permanence associated with the experience.\nDrop what you are doing, and rest in open, effortless awareness. Let go of any mental effort, and simply be.&nbsp;\nNext, notice what you are seeing or hearing. Examine how there is an expectation that the forms and sounds that you experience should be consistent throughout the meditation. Simply notice the sense of permanence associated with sensory experiences.\nNext, expand your investigation to include emotional patterns or personality traits that seem permanent. Notice any words, images, or thoughts in your mind. For instance, you might have been labeling who you are with a particular expression or idea for a while. See if you can step back and simply notice the sense of permanence that is associated with the sense of self.&nbsp;\nIf you feel ready to do so, continue to investigate implicit views about yourself which construct self-identity. This often includes strong characteristics, as well as aspects of our role in family life or at work. Examine aspects of your self-identity functioning in your experience right now. Perhaps you have a view of yourself as a \"good meditator\" or a \"bad meditator.\" If this is the case, see if you can investigate this view more closely, and notice what you feel in your body and/or mind. Gain insight into your own identity. Be curious and see what you notice.&nbsp;\nOnce again, bring awareness to your body or sensory experiences such as sounds. Notice how things are changing in each and every moment. Rest in the flow of change.&nbsp;\nThen, notice where you resist change in your life. You do not need to judge anything, but stay with your clear intention to open up to change. Be open and curious. End session Let go of the investigation, and simply rest in open awareness.\nSlowly open your eyes if they have been closed. Look around, and take in what you see and hear with a sense of appreciation and warmth.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you investigate the sense of self during meditation, do you experience resistance towards seeing it as impermanent? Can you identify situations in your life where this resistance manifests?Whatever your experience might be while practicing with impermanence, simply be with it.

First, we look at ourselves and see pieces. Second, different aspects. Third, we might see that it is changing and that there are different selves in different moments and different parts of our life. Seeing this is really good.\nBut normally, when we are not looking at the self, there is a sense of what we call \"permanence,\" the sense that we really want to hold onto some kind of consistency. So there are a lot of fixed ideas that we have. \"This is the way. This is what should be. This must be it. This is right.\" There are so many ideas that we have in our life. And that belief is shaken by the truth — the \"truth\" meaning that the real situation in our life is that it is changing. Everything is changing and impermanent. Then what happens is that we have a lot of fear, and feelings of anxiety, instability, groundlessness, and being unsafe. We have all this fear. We really want to have stability, without change, but life is always changing. Life is like the waves of the ocean. Life is like the stock market, going up and down all the time. Then, there is a feeling of insecurity on a deeper level, the feeling that something is missing, incomplete, or unsafe, and that is what we call \"causes of suffering\" in our life. And that can be manifested in our social life, family life, workplace — everywhere.\nMaybe I will tell you a story. One time, I was teaching meditation, and there was one elderly lady who really wanted to make an appointment with me. When I met her, at the beginning she just cried. I said, \"What happened?\" She cried and said, \"Look at my face.\" I looked at her face, and she was quite cute actually. I did not see anything in particular. Then she said, \"There are wrinkles on my face. Can you see the wrinkles?\" I said yes. And she said that these wrinkles drove her crazy. She did not want to have those wrinkles, and she also said, \"My face has become like a dried-up mushroom.\" She was really sad about that, and when she looked in the mirror, what she saw were the wrinkles. She felt really unhappy, and sometimes she would break the mirror. But a few days later, she would need to buy another mirror. When she would look at the new mirror, she said, what she had lost was the mirror, not the wrinkles. And she asked me, \"What should I do?\" I told her, \"Try to accept impermanence. Life is like the stock market. Life is like the waves of the ocean, going up and down. Try to accept that.\" She said, \"I tried that, and it does not help.\" Then I told her a story about my grandma. My grandma was full of wrinkles, and she was very cute. For me, my grandma was quite beautiful and cute.\nWhat happens normally in our life is that the things that we do not have, we really want. And the things we already have we do not really appreciate. We do not see the value in them. Sometimes, when I teach around the world and some small kids come, I ask them, \"How old are you?\" \"Seven years, seven months, ten days.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] They know their exact age, and they really want to be eighteen years old. They do not like that they are children. But when we become eighteen years old, we are looking for something else. Actually, each age of our life has different possibilities, different experiences, different things we can explore, different capacities, and different flavors and tastes. So many different things. It is a journey! When you are young, you have something you do not have when you are getting older. But then you have new experiences, new knowledge, new ways to see life that you do not have when you are young. Each stage of life has different qualities and its own value. Normally we do not see that. And we have this anxiety and panic if we do not accept that.\nWith this sense of permanence, we really want to hold onto things. Actually, we are changing all the time; we are dying every day. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But if we do not want to die, then actually we die. If we let ourself die, we actually are being reborn. It is fresh in every moment. That grasping of permanence prevents us from seeing different aspects of life. We do not see that life is full of potential, possibilities, and has different doors. When you accept that, there are so many different doors. Like my father said, \"When you are going somewhere and you reach a dead-end, throw your backpack over the wall first.\" You might not cross that way, but there are different ways that you can cross the wall. Likewise, there are many possibilities in your life.\nWhen we really see and accept that, what happens is that we feel more open, and the fear goes away. Why does fear come? Because what we expect, what we see, and how things are do not match. So then there is fear.\nWhen I was young, I tried to climb a rotten, dead tree. From the outside, it looked very solid and big. But when I held onto it, it broke because it was hollow on the inside. Then my grandma came and said, \"Do not do that.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So if we want to perceive everything as solid, unchanging, and permanent, then every time we will be disappointed and upset, because reality is changing and changing. Grasping prevents creativity, prevents flexibility, and prevents us from developing relationships also. If we really want to develop our relationships and to learn new things about each other every day, we can try something different, something new. That really helps.\nAt the feeling level, on a deeper level, there is a sense of consistency. For example, if you are waiting in line and someone cuts in front of you, suddenly what happens is that you think \"me, me, me.\" Now the sense of self burns, explodes, freezes, or disappears. Why? Because you think, \"This is the way it should be. They are not supposed to cut in line. This is my right and how it ought to be.\" There are so many ideas there. But maybe the other person did not see you, or maybe they are having some emergency. There are various reasons there, but normally we do not see that, and suddenly we feel upset. That is not only with waiting in line but also with whatever happens in your life. There is a sense of continuity.\nMaybe I will ask you a question. Did you eat anything yesterday? If yes, raise your hand. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Of course, you might say yes, unless you are fasting. Normally we think, \"I ate yesterday.\" We are thinking that yesterday's \"me\" and today's \"me\" are the same. But actually, we change, we have time. Yesterday's \"me\" is not the same as today's \"me.\" Did you study your ABCs when you were young? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Yes? Or \"Ah-Bah-Cah\" or whatever it is in your own language. Yes? That is also the sense of permanence. The \"you\" when you studied your ABCs was maybe this big. [Mingyur Rinpoche raises his hand as if trying to determine a young person's height.] And now you are very big, right? It is changing and changing. But we see it as the same thing.\nWhen this goes into our everyday life, we do not want to entertain new ideas. On a deeper level, from the healthy sense of self, we like to have new ideas. Then, on the surface level, we do not like new ideas. There is fighting. On a deeper level, we want to be creative. On the surface level, we think, \"No, no, this is dangerous.\" So, which one do we like? Actually, creativity is better, isn't it? Flexibility is better, an open mind is better. And to be really fresh and new, to see the world in fresh and new ways, is better.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains how our grasping at permanence leads to suffering because our beliefs do not match the way things are. If you were to explain this to a friend, how would you do so? Question 2\nMany of us do not appreciate what we have but instead wish for something different. How would you describe the best way to open up and begin to appreciate what we have? Points to remember:\nLife is constantly changing like waves of the ocean.\nYou experience suffering when holding onto permanence.\nWhen your beliefs do not match reality, you can experience fear and disappointment.\nInquiry\nAre you the same person today as you were yesterday?\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow the perspective of impermanence manifests in everyday life\nabout subtle forms of grasping at permanence Joyful Wisdom, pp. 106-109 (Ch. 5, \"Permanence\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.1 Welcome to Impermanence and Transformation Meditation\" data-href=\"3.3.1 Welcome to Impermanence and Transformation Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.1-welcome-to-impermanence-and-transformation-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.1 Welcome To Impermanence And Transformation, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.1 welcome to impermanence and transformation, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.1 View","throw your backpack over the wall","backpack analogy"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Impermanence and Self: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Impermanence_and_Self_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.1-welcome-to-impermanence-and-transformation-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.1-welcome-to-impermanence-and-transformation-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476075,"modifiedTime":1759272587655,"sourceSize":9837,"sourcePath":"1.

See how the things around you are changing. And if you have some kind of problem or obstacle right now, it will change also. At the same time, when you try to accept impermanence, you might find some other solutions. A door for different possibilities, not just one. You might see some new ideas. There will be more creativity, and more flexibility also.\nTry to embrace the change of the self from your workplace to your home. Do not bring the self from your workplace to your home. If you do not accept change, you will bring the self from your workplace home and make family life unhappy. Or if you bring the self from your family life into your workplace, that will influence your workplace also. In your workplace, if you feel stressed and bring that stress home, there are a lot of problems. This happens nowadays. Or maybe there is stress and unhappiness in your home, and you bring that to your workplace.\nLet go and try to enjoy every new step, and to see and appreciate impermanence. Actually, impermanence is really nice. It is fresh. You see the world in a fresh way every time. Of course, there is continuation, and that is totally fine. See this continuation, but also how there is change within the continuation. It is wonderful!\nAlso, try to do something new. That really helps to break habits, the old, permanent habits. If you want to go to your workplace, try to explore different roads if you have time. You know, time is impermanent, so you can manage it. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] If you usually only take one way, you can try other ways. Maybe someday, if it is at a close distance, you can walk and explore new places. Try to explore new roads, explore new ideas.\nThat also goes for relationships at home. Try to learn from each other, every day, a little bit. Explore something together. If you have friends or family with you, explore something new together! That is really good for your relationship. It enhances the relationship. And it really helps our life become more flexible, open, creative, and happy. The unhealthy sense of self that easily cries, easily burns, and easily freezes becomes less.\nTry this in your life, and that will be really beneficial.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nTake a few minutes to reflect on and write down three to five changing elements you see around you in your daily life. For instance, you can begin with the gross level of impermanence and include things such as the weather, relationships, birth, death, etc. Alternatively, you can include the subtle level of impermanence with things such as the changes of the breath, organs, and notion of time. Once complete, choose an element of this list and, looking more closely, cultivate a sense of appreciation for its impermanent nature.\nAlternate the above practice with an exploration of your habits and patterns. Choose one specific habit or pattern that you have, such as doing a usual activity with someone you love, or taking the same route to work everyday, and try to disrupt this habit or pattern in some small way. Be specific about when you intend to apply this practice. For instance, you may change the route you take to your workplace or while on your daily walk. Try something completely new and notice how you view the sense of self within this particular situation.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nAs you embrace the principles of impermanence in your life, what happens to your sense of self? Do you experience a clearer sense of who you really are?\nWhat is a situation in daily life in which you feel hesitant or fearful to apply this practice? What strategies could you apply to use this situation as support for your practice?\nInquiry\nHow can you use obstacles and challenges in your life as a gateway for recognizing the principle of impermanence?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence Summary\" data-href=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.2 Wisdom Of Impermanence, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.2 wisdom of impermanence, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.2 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Wisdom of Impermanence: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Wisdom_of_Impermanence_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476064,"modifiedTime":1759272587668,"sourceSize":4899,"sourcePath":"1.

This is Antonia again. Good to be back with you. This week, we are going to explore the wisdom of impermanence.\nFor me, personally, these teachings and the practices that we will be doing have been truly life-changing. I just remember — when I was first really beginning to practice with these instructions and having a close look at what is going on in my own experience — how I went from having that very solid sense of self to starting to see how it changes all the time. And not just how I change and how what I hold onto as myself is changing all the time, but how it is also the case for others. It is really this process that we have been talking about of moving from the intellectual, conceptual understanding of impermanence to something that we experience directly, something that becomes more embodied. And when we really begin to look closely, we start to see that things are not the way we thought they were. We start to see that what we were perceiving more through concepts is actually not what we see when we have a closer look at what is unfolding in our own experience.\nAnd when I say that, for me personally, it has been life-changing, I mean it has helped me so much with my own stuck view of myself that often made it very difficult for me to move on in my life into new situations, into new relationships. But just beginning to allow some of that to open up, allow the mind and heart to open up, created some more flow and more openness to not knowing what will happen. Knowing that everything will change actually brings with it an openness.\nI also saw this very much in my relationships, in relationship to people who are close to me, with whom sometimes there could be this way of boxing them into a specific perception, a specific view. Really seeing impermanence, seeing change, and being open to that also opens up our perception so that other people in our life can shine in their own right and can also have more freedom and more space to change.\nI really encourage you to practice with the instructions that you will be receiving and also to bring the view that you will be hearing about and that you will be exploring into all the different situations in your life — so that it is something that you explore on a larger scale but also in some everyday and very familiar situations.\nI wish you a good time with the practice. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence View\" data-href=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.2 Wisdom Of Impermanence, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.2 wisdom of impermanence, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Wisdom of Impermanence (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Wisdom_of_Impermanence_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476055,"modifiedTime":1759272587674,"sourceSize":3069,"sourcePath":"1.

We learned about impermanence already. You know what impermanence is, but to bring that into our being, feelings, subconscious mind, and body, we have to have meditation.\nFor example, you might say, \"Oh yes, life is like the waves of the ocean. Wonderful, isn't it? I can learn from this. Life is colorful.\" But when you are really facing problems, you forget about impermanence. You fall into permanence, the grasping of permanence, and feel upset, with fear, anxiety, or hopelessness. To bring this into our experiential level, we have to learn and practice meditation. To practice meditation, we can begin with breathing or sound meditation. Sound is always changing. There is a beginning, there is an end, and it never stops changing. From beginning to end, it is changing and changing. [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.]\nLike \"Mingyur Rinpoche.\" \"Min-gyur.\" When you hear \"gyur,\" \"Min\" is already gone. You are in the \"gyur.\" \"Rin.\" When you say \"Rin,\" \"Mingyur\" is already gone. \"Po\" has not come; it has not manifested yet. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] \"Mingyur Rin-po-che\" It is changing. \"Min-gyur Rin-po-che.\" Isn't it? But what happens in our mind is that we try to put all of this together on a conceptual level and make it solid, single, one, independent. So, actually \"Mingyur Rinpoche\" is just an idea. Your ear cannot hear \"Mingyur Rinpoche,\" can it? You think you hear it, but you hear it on the conceptual level, the idea level. On the conceptual level, \"Mingyur Rinpoche\" is permanent, single, and independent. But, really, it is changing and changing.\nSo we can begin with sound or the breath. Maybe we will use the breath right now. Please keep your spine loosely straight. And first, rest your mind in open awareness. You can close or open your eyes. Normally in level three, we recommend beginning to open your eyes. When you begin to open your eyes, then your meditation is easier to bring into everyday life.\nNow, please be aware of your breath. Breathing in, breathing out. And your breath is always changing. When you inhale, oxygen comes [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers], moment by moment, through your nose and throat and fills your lungs. When you exhale, carbon dioxide is going out and changes the air quality. Your lungs become smaller and smaller. And when you breathe in, your lungs are expanding and changing.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, not only your breath and lungs are changing, but at the same time, your heartbeat is changing. Your heart and your heartbeat are changing second by second. [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.]\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd not only the heart but the blood circulation is changing. Your entire body, from head to feet, is changing second by second. And the breath, the oxygen, goes through your entire body. When you breathe in, you are actually also breathing from your pores. Throughout the body, they are breathing in and breathing out.\nAnd not only the blood and breath are changing, but all the cells in your body are changing right now. And these cells are made of atoms. And all these atoms are changing. Protons, neutrons, electrons — everything is changing, like the solar system. They are moving around each other, and timewise they are changing and changing. They never stay in the present moment. The present is changing, changing. From beginning to end.\n[Silent meditation]\nAnd now, not only your body is changing, but the feeling in your body is changing, at the gross level, from pleasant to unpleasant, unpleasant to neutral, hot to cold, cold to neutral . . .\nAnd at a subtle level, even if you are experiencing a pleasant or an unpleasant feeling, that unpleasant feeling is changing second by second, moment by moment.\nThe feeling of depression, panic, low self-esteem, stress, or hatred is changing. Not only is the feeling changing, but your mind and your thoughts are changing. The ideas are changing. The images in your mind are changing. The words in your mind are changing.\n[Silent meditation]\nNot only are our body and mind changing, but all phenomena are changing. The place where you are staying is changing. The town or city where you are staying is changing. The earth is changing, and the entire universe is changing right now, at the same time as your breath. When you breathe in, it is changing. Moment by moment, the entire universe is changing. Moment by moment, when you breathe out, it is changing. The entire universe is changing.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n180 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;6 days&nbsp;of practice Begin session Begin by finding a comfortable body posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease and relaxation. If there is any tightness or tension in the body, that is okay. Try to allow whatever is present to be there.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.\nNext, take a few deep breaths. On the exhalation, simply let be, and rest in open awareness. Main practice Begin with bringing awareness to your body. Notice how sensations continually change. For instance, you might be aware of the inhalation and exhalation of the breath or other pleasant or unpleasant sensations. Simply observe how the sensations are changing.\nNow, expand your investigation to include the environment around you. Reflect on how sounds, smells, the light in the room, etc., are changing. Notice the experience of how hearing and seeing can flow from one to another. Notice all the changes that happen here. Rest in the dynamic process of change.&nbsp;\nNext, see if you can be aware of your mind, particularly any thoughts that are present. Notice how thoughts are composed of images, words, or both. Examine how the various aspects of thoughts are constantly changing. Rest in the dynamic process of change.&nbsp;\nIf you experience a gap or no thoughts, simply rest in open awareness.\nNow, notice how the entire world, as you experience it, is changing. Examine the changing nature of phenomena. End session Let go of any inquiries, and simply rest in open awareness.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. While examining the impermanence of breath and resting in the dynamic experience of it, do you find this practice accessible? Why or why not?When you investigate the impermanence of thoughts or feelings, are you able to observe them? Do you notice anything new while engaging in this style of meditation? Explain why or why not.While expanding your meditation to include all phenomena such as your town or city, the earth, or the entire universe, what is your lived experience? Please explain.Tip\nWithin each moment lies the potential to know the dynamic nature of who you truly are.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence Application\" data-href=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.2 Wisdom Of Impermanence, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.2 wisdom of impermanence, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.2 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Wisdom of Impermanence: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Wisdom_of_Impermanence_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476039,"modifiedTime":1759272587679,"sourceSize":8279,"sourcePath":"1.

That is really good, actually. For example, the self at home is different than the self at your workplace. The happy self changes when you are not happy — then the self is not happy. When you are doing something virtuous and meaningful, there is a sense of a good self. Or when you are making some mistakes, not-so-good things, there is a sense of a bad self. Or it is the self that is related to your job title and responsibilities. And also the self has changed from childhood to now. When you were young, you liked something particular. You thought about yourself with a different self-image. Now it is changing. And things that you used to believe about yourself you no longer believe. Now you have new beliefs, new ideas.\nActually, we are constantly changing. When you see that, that is really great. The important thing is that we need to accept that, we need to be with that. The self is changing all the time — let it be that way. But change opens possibilities, new doors, and new opportunities in life. There might be a new solution that you never saw before. When you do not want to change and you are fixed on that, then you do not see other opportunities and you give up. You do not try. There is no hope. But when we see things are changing and impermanent, there are a lot of possibilities there. So, actually, there is hope. Sometimes many friends and students come to me during a breakup, and it feels like the end of the world to them. They are really feeling bad. But sometimes during that breakup, they learn and grow a lot. After a few years, they think, \"Oh, that was wonderful.\" That may happen.\nI had panic attacks when I was young, but I did not listen to the panic. I tried to find a solution. I learned meditation. Maybe one of the reasons I am here teaching meditation is because of my panic. The panic became my teacher and my friend. And I went on a wandering retreat and let go of everything. I had no particular plan for lodging and did not have a lot of money — just a few thousand rupees that were gone within a few weeks. In the beginning, it was really difficult, but now when I look at that experience, I see that I actually learned a lot. It really helped me by benefiting and improving my meditation, and I learned a lot about life. Actually, accepting life's ups and downs is really beneficial. And even now, although I teach meditation, I have many responsibilities. I look after three monasteries — one in Nepal, one in India, and one in Tibet — and international meditation organizations in many different parts of the world. And many students really want to learn. So I need to handle many things, but at the same time, I accept impermanence. I try my best to help things go the right way and be meaningful and beneficial. Sometimes they do, sometimes they do not. Life is changing. I am not too tight about the result, but I try my best to use whatever I have — skills, methods, experience, knowledge . . . With whatever I have, I try my best and do not care too much about the result. That really helps me, and my mind is really at peace. At a deeper level, I am quite peaceful. And then I can do more actually. If I am tight, I cannot do a lot.\nTherefore, to see that life is changing is really important. How to see that life is changing? There are what we call \"two types of impermanence\": the gross level of impermanence, or gross continuity impermanence, and subtle momentary impermanence. We have these two. Gross impermanence means there is a continuation. And when that stream of continuation changes to another continuation, that is the gross level. It is like a flower growing and growing, becoming bigger, and that same flower then blooming. And then the flower dies, and when the flower becomes rotten, totally dead, at that time the continuation of the flower is no more. The flower is dry or totally rotten and becomes soil. When the flower becomes soil, that is what we call \"impermanence.\"\nThat happens in our lives, you know? There are new relationships, and then those relationships go away — that is impermanence. Life goes up, and when it goes down, that is impermanence. When it is down and goes up, that is impermanence. A person is born, and when they die that becomes impermanence. Looking for or starting a new job is impermanence, and the ending of that job is impermanence. So, there is a continuation. When the continuation is gone, then we see it is impermanent. That is the gross level.\nBut at the subtle level, actually, we are changing every moment, right now. Every second, we are changing. Your whole body is changing. The cells in your body are changing. Even the continuation of the cells in your body is changing. Every seven years, the cells in your body have totally changed. Even the continuation is changed into some other continuation. But right now, also, cells are changing, at every moment. Your heart, your breath, your blood circulation. And not only your body, but also the world, the planet, and the entire universe are changing right now. On a subtle level, we need to see this change. When we accept change and can be with impermanence, at the beginning, we might have a little bit of fear, a little fear of losing ourselves, but eventually, our mind becomes more stable, more peaceful, and calmer. Then creativity comes. There is more flexibility, openness, and more energy. Actually, we have more energy. We feel happy, but we can see the dance of life, and we can grow with the ups and downs also. The ups are good, but the downs are sometimes even better. We learn more from the downs; we grow more from the downs. So actually, ups and downs are really good for learning and growing. They become your teacher. They become your best friend.\nFor example, in Tibet, we have a very famous businessperson. Everybody calls him \"Norbu Sangpo.\" This businessperson is named Norbu Sangpo. And he did business between Tibet and China. He had thousands of yaks, and at that time there were no railways or cars, so they carried things on the backs of the yaks. They had so much jewelry, cotton, and tea, and so many different things. In the beginning, he tried to do this business, and he went bankrupt. He started the business, and then it was gone. Again, he started. He went bankrupt nine times, and in the end, he thought he wanted to give up. He went to a grass field and lied down. He thought, \"Now, I cannot do anything.\" And he looked at the grass, and there was one ant trying to climb a blade of grass. It would almost reach the top and fall down, and, again, almost reach the top and fall down. Nine times. The last time, success! It reached the top of the grass, and there was some kind of fruit there on top to enjoy. I think the ant enjoyed it and was very happy. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] And the businessperson thought, \"I will not give up.\" So, in the end, he became a very successful businessperson.\nTherefore, of course, sometimes, as I mentioned, we cannot cross one way, but there are different ways. This is a really important aspect of the impermanence of life.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nWhat are the two types of impermanence, and can you provide two examples of your own to illustrate them? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that in living with the principle of impermanence, we will be able to discover more possibilities and opportunities in life. How would you explain the importance of seeing the impermanence of self to a friend? Points to remember:\nWhen we investigate the sense of self, we see the impermanence of self.\nWhen we fully recognize impermanence, we experience new possibilities.\nThe two types of impermanence are gross and subtle.\nWe slowly gain confidence and become more flexible when seeing the impermanent nature of ourselves and the worlds we inhabit.\nTip\nEvery breath you take is a moment to recognize impermanence.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow conceptual labels or names are created based on conditions\nstrategies to apply the perspective of impermanence to self and phenomena\nthe benefits of contemplating impermanence The Joy of Living, pp. 91-93 (Ch. 5, \"Impermanence\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence Meditation\" data-href=\"3.3.2 Wisdom of Impermanence Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.2 Wisdom Of Impermanence, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.2 wisdom of impermanence, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Wisdom of Impermanence: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Wisdom_of_Impermanence_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.2-wisdom-of-impermanence-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476033,"modifiedTime":1759272587692,"sourceSize":9506,"sourcePath":"1.

The emotion or its object may dissipate with practice.

And normally we have patterns in everyday life. Maybe you have a pattern of arguing, of not wanting to lose face, the singularity, the self-image. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Or you want to show off or impress. To a certain degree, that is okay. And especially if it helps you and others, that is okay. But then there are a lot of things that are not really helpful. In the long term, it will not be good for you or others. But anyway, whether it is useful or not, when we look at it with wisdom it will transform. It will become healthier. It will help us to free ourselves.&nbsp;\nMaybe you go into your workplace, and ten minutes later, \"Boom!\" The hatred comes. Look at the nature of hatred. Look at yourself. \"Who is hating?\" You can analyze or just be with the sense of \"me\" who hates somebody. Or maybe there is jealousy in your workplace. Much of the time there is a lot of jealousy. That may happen. When you are jealous and you are not happy, you are restless. Look at that. Or confusion. \"I do not know. I am not good, I am a loser.\" You can also look at that. And normally you have pride. \"I know everything.\" Eventually, that becomes an obstacle for you, but you do not know how to transform it the right way. Sometimes we do not want to have pride, but the pride comes and it is out of our control. You can look at that, like with jealousy.\nYou can try this, and the most important thing is to catch the emotion. Try to catch it, then look at its nature. And when you finish your work and go back to your home, maybe you begin an argument with your family members about small matters. \"I asked you to put this flower on that table, not that table.\" Or there is a problem with the cushion, the chair, the cooking, the garden, or the flowers . . .&nbsp;\nThis habit comes continuously, so we can look at it. I think this really helps, so you can see how our lives are related to each other's and interdependent. Maybe you are looking at your smartphone, and when you look at it, you might have the habit of playing games too much. Then you go to bed late, and in the morning you cannot get up for work. There is craving there. \"I want to stop using my smartphone!\" but then you grab your smartphone. You can look at this craving. The craving is very strong and out of control. Look at that, and there are pieces — images, and voices. Just by looking at the craving, it helps to slowly, slowly free yourself.&nbsp;\nThere is a story about one of my students and friends. He is a very famous therapist. He wrote many books and has helped many people. And I asked him, \"What is the secret of your therapy?\" And he said that actually he just lets the other person talk; he just listens. And then he asks a question in such a way that the other person really brings awareness to their emotions and problems. And he asks them to write many lists and asks, \"What is your trigger?\" \"When do you have this problem? And when you have this problem, what are the sensations? the images? the voices?\" And I told him, \"You stole my teaching.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But actually, a lot of this is happening in therapy right now. He just listens, he does not do too much, in a way, but he asks the right question and develops their awareness. And the person makes a list because it will help them find all these pieces, the multiplicity, and then how these pieces relate to each other and how all of this is changing. When we bring awareness, awareness is like light, right? It will really transform us.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesJournal Reflection QuestionsTip\nThere is no right or wrong emotional pattern to experience.

In this section, Rinpoche teaches about the main five negative emotions and how we can transform them into wisdom. What it means to transform emotions is to be with the emotions, even for a short period of time, so that you can look at the sense of self that is operating underneath the emotion.&nbsp;\nIn my own experience of staying present with emotions, I learned that I was bringing everything I have learned into a particular moment of transforming emotions. For instance, it is the awareness that is the foundation of this investigation. It is love and compassion towards myself to be gentle in the process and recognize my wish to be happy and free from this discomfort of feeling the emotion. And then, it is innate wisdom to see clearly how the self or the notion of \"I\" is involved. Here, we are not asked to change who we truly are, but simply given an opportunity to experiment with what it means to live our lives more in line with the way things are and our true nature.&nbsp;\nI really hope you will apply these teachings to your life, so that you can use everything as an opportunity to further explore these teachings. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.3 Transformation and Emotion View\" data-href=\"3.3.3 Transformation and Emotion View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.3-transformation-and-emotion-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.3 Transformation And Emotion, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.3 transformation and emotion, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Transformation and Emotion (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Transformation_and_Emotion_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.3-transformation-and-emotion-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.3-transformation-and-emotion-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475974,"modifiedTime":1759272587720,"sourceSize":1910,"sourcePath":"1.

The method is awareness. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Awareness goes all the way from the first step of meditation until the highest level of meditation. But then, what are the differences between these levels? Awareness becomes deeper and clearer. That is the journey.\nNow, what you are going to do is, if you have those emotions with you, the five kleshas — craving, hatred, ignorance, pride, and jealousy — if you have them now, presently, look at the sense of self at this moment. \"I want that\" — craving. \"I do not like that, I hate it\" — hatred. \"I do not know\" — ignorance. \"I am the best\" — pride. \"This is not good news. My friend/colleague has become better than me.\" That is the \"me, me, me.\"\nFirst, please keep your spine loosely straight, but do not rest in open awareness. Try to first create one of the kleshas. If you have very strong kleshas, if one klesha is very strong within you, maybe do not try to create this one now. Sometimes we feel overwhelmed, and then we cannot practice. If you do not have any of the kleshas, remember one of the strong kleshas that you have experienced in the past.&nbsp;\nOkay, now ask yourself, \"Who hates?\" \"Me, me.\" So look at yourself. You become pieces: body, mind, images, voices, your name, and feelings. There are so many pieces. And with hatred, look at the nature of hatred. Hatred has pieces also, like images — the image of a person, an animal, or maybe yourself, or maybe a thing. Then there are the words. \"He - is - not - good.\" \"She - is - not - good.\" Whatever the reason is, these words are changing. \"He - is - not - good.\" They are changing and have a lot of pieces also.&nbsp;\nAnd there are sensations in your body, and the sensations are also changing. They are impermanent. From the stomach to the heart. Then they go to the head. And then behind all these, there is a belief: \"This is right. This is wrong. This is how it should be. This is the way.\" Please, look at that.\nAnd anger and hatred are not solid like a rock. They are not strong like a fire. They are like clouds. They are just interdependent. Hatred cannot exist without an object. Hatred cannot exist without feeling or sensation in the body and mind, or without a belief or reason. \"They might have a reason. Right?\" How interesting! The hatred becomes 3D now. There are so many pieces. One over there, one here, and one there. It is like shaving foam.\nNow, please rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nTry this again and again. It really helped me. When I was young, I had panic attacks. When I experienced panic, sometimes I felt it so strong, like a rock, or like water boiling inside my body. But when I looked into that, there were pieces. Sensations, images, voices, reasons, and beliefs. And once you see these pieces, it helps. The power diminishes. The power of negative emotions is diminished already. Plus, it is changing, it is interdependent. If you take out one part, then it is not easy to find that emotion. For me, it really helped. So try to do that. And you know by now about multiplicity, impermanence, and interdependence. Try to understand that this is the nature of the self, the nature of the emotion, or klesha itself. That goes for ignorance and for everything — all the other kleshas.&nbsp;\nBut if you cannot find them . . . There are five experiences, right? When you look at the self, maybe you can see them. They are there, and you can experience them. Maybe you cannot see them. There is a gap. If you cannot find the emotion, that is great. If you cannot find the self, that is great. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Do not worry. You will not get lost. Who is not finding this? You, also. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You are not finding yourself. That is wonderful! It is not \"nothing,\" do not worry. But it is not existing in a solid, single, independent way.\nApply this again and again. Then, after a certain level, when emotion comes, you will have a habit. You will see pieces, change, and interdependence. Therefore, it really helps to develop awareness. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice Begin session Take a moment to find a comfortable posture that helps you feel both awake and alert, but most importantly at ease and relaxed. Close your eyes if you find it helpful.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice how your body feels.\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest naturally.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice your current emotional state. If no emotion is present, either conjure up an emotion or bring to mind a memory that brings with it an emotional response. Get curious and simply notice what is happening. Remember, do not start with anything too overwhelming. Whatever you choose should feel workable.\nNow, examine the emotion from inside, and notice different dimensions of your experience. For instance, you might be aware of physical sensations associated with this emotion. Or you might notice words, images, or thoughts that move through your mind. Examine the different parts of this experience.\nTake a short break from all the investigation, and rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nNext, examine how this emotional experience is constantly changing, and how nothing stays the same from one moment to the next. For instance, you might notice that the physical sensations in your body, or words, impressions, or memories in your mind, are all shifting. Observe the constant change.\nOnce again, rest in open awareness.\nNext, examine how different circumstances, conditions, or factors come together to shape this emotional experience. For instance, whatever is happening in your body is a contributing factor to this experience. Or you might experience mental aspects, such as personality characteristics, habitual patterns, or beliefs that you have about yourself. You do not need to judge yourself, but rather see it more clearly. Notice the interdependent factors involved in this emotional experience coming to be.\nIf you would like to explore this further, notice other experiences, including events that are happening or have happened in the world around you, or even in your distant past, that contribute to this experience. End session Slowly open your eyes. Take a moment to move your body, and notice the richness of this moment. Appreciate the fact that you have taken this time to practice, and notice how that feels at this moment.\nLet go, and simply rest in open awareness.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche suggests looking at the sense of self through the principles of multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence in the moment of experiencing an emotion. Does this impact the way that you relate to the emotion itself? If so, please explain.As you investigate the many aspects of a negative emotion, does its power increase or lessen?

One time, a person came to me and said, \"In your meditation tradition, in particular, you always focus on the self, especially with wisdom,\" and he asked, \"Why?\" Normally, the real technique, the real skill to free ourselves and have peace and happiness is wisdom. Wisdom is like a light. Once there is a light, the darkness is automatically illuminated, right? There is no need to fight with the darkness.\nIn order to have wisdom, we have to know the general nature of phenomena. When we want to know the general nature of phenomena, the truth of phenomena, or the true nature of phenomena, we have to start with just one phenomenon or object first. We say, \"If you know the general nature of one phenomenon, then you will know the general nature of all phenomena.\" Therefore we have to start with one object. Then we can look at which object is the best. Now, here, it is the self. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] The self is the best object because the self is making us feel suffering, confusion, fear, depression, or not in peace. There are a lot of problems in our life coming from not recognizing the self, from not knowing who we are. Therefore, we use the self as the object. But here, once we understand the general nature of the self, then we can apply that with all phenomena. We can apply it to a table, a person, a house, everything. Everything is the same.\nNow here, I would like to focus more on emotions. How does this meditation help to transform emotions? What is an emotion? We have many emotions. Now, I want to focus on five negative emotions first, what we sometimes call the \"five kleshas.\" If you can transform them, then all the other emotions are easy. What are these five kleshas? The first is what we call \"craving,\" or \"grasping,\" or what we sometimes call \"attachment.\" Not all attachments are bad; some attachments are good. It depends on the object, but if it becomes too much like craving, out of control, then we become restless. That is the problem.\nCraving is the first, and the second is hatred. Craving means, \"I really want this!\" \"I have to get this first, before anybody else.\" Or, \"What about me? What is the benefit for me? Is there anything useful for me? If this is not useful for me, I do not care about it.\" It is a very strong, self-centric grasping and craving. That is based on the self, right? And not knowing the healthy sense of self, actually. What we are perceiving is that it is a single, permanent, independent self, very solid, strong, touchy, and sensitive. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] As I mentioned before, you know? And that self is looking for something, and then you cannot sleep in the night sometimes. Sometimes that becomes a problem. Sometimes even in dreams you are not happy and feel burning here [Mingyur Rinpoche gestures to indicate sensation rising in his chest]. The grasping also becomes a problem then. That is because of not knowing the self; it is based on the unhealthy sense of self.\nAnd the second, hatred, is, \"I do not like this, I hate this!\" Hatred causes a lot of negative emotions. It is what we sometimes call \"aversion,\" and it is a cause of suffering. A lot of panic, depression, and all this comes from hatred, not wanting something. And you do not see. When you look at things through hatred, you will not see beautiful things. You will not see pleasant things. You will not see nice things. You just do not like it and feel hatred. \"I do not like this!\" And that will become really strong and solid. That is hatred.\nAnd then the third is ignorance, \"I do not know.\" Confusion, doubt, the mind becomes restless, and you worry about and doubt everything. There is uncertainty. That is ignorance. And it is based on \"me,\" \"I do not know, what should I do?\" \"Me, me, me.\"\nNumber four is pride. \"I am the best. They know nothing.\" One time, I was in France, and someone said a proud gesture is something like this. [Mingyur Rinpoche touches his nose with his finger and laughs.] I think many places in Europe use that. Then that might lead to a lot of problems, and that is especially why you cannot learn, why you cannot really grow actually, once you are fixated on pride. If you have too much pride, it is not good. Confidence, appreciation, and gratitude are different from pride. Pride is when you are putting others down.\nAnd the last one is jealousy. Jealousy also comes from \"me.\" \"My friend and I were both good, but now my friend has become better than me.\" \"Now my friend is more educated.\" \"Now my friend gets a bigger salary. What should I do? How can I create an obstacle for my friend? This is not good news.\" That is jealousy.\nHow can we transform these kleshas? You cannot transform these kleshas by suppressing or trying to get rid of them. We talked about this in level one, right? When we say \"no pizza,\" what happens? We think about pizza more. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Sometimes we say, \"Do not be angry. I do not want to be angry,\" and then we go to the office and ten minutes later, \"Boom!\" Anger comes like a volcanic eruption. \"Oops!\" Too late.\nEven if you can suppress it for a while, that will have a lot of side effects. Or maybe you should listen to the kleshas, listen to hatred, listen to craving? Then, your life will become out of control. You will not be in peace, right? They will become your bad boss. Normally, I say that if you suppress these kleshas, they will become your enemy. If you totally listen to them, they will become your bad boss.\nSo what should we do? Do not do anything. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You do not have to do anything. You just see; you just look at their nature. Look at the nature of the self, and then it will transform. It will transform into support for awareness, into your friend, and into your teacher also. You can learn from this. And then, also, it may transform into love and compassion, and it may transform into wisdom. Therefore, the root of all of these kleshas is the \"me, me, me\" — especially the unhealthy sense of me. And the unhealthy sense of me comes when we are not seeing the unhealthy sense of self. Of course, we feel that it is there, but we are not looking at it. When we are not looking at it, we are lost in the unhealthy sense of self. When you look, you are out of that. Actually, you are bigger than the unhealthy sense of self. It is wonderful, isn't it?\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nGiven what you have learned from this video as well as in course one, specifically regarding how suffering is divided into natural suffering and self-created suffering, how would you answer the following question: Why is the self the most important aspect of practice in regard to connecting with wisdom? Question 2\nHow can simply looking at emotions and the sense of self transform emotions into support for awareness, compassion, and wisdom? Points to remember:\nWisdom is that which frees you from suffering and in turn helps you achieve peace and happiness.\nTo connect with wisdom, the practice is to know the true nature of phenomena.\nIn order to connect with wisdom, the best object of meditation is the self.\nThe five kleshas (or afflictive emotions) refer to ignorance, aversion, attachment, pride, and jealousy.\nWe can transform emotions by leaving them as they are while remaining in awareness.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow to recognize the three principles of multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence with thoughts and emotions\nthree possible experiences when applying meditation to emotions\nhow problems can become opportunities\nthe first two of the four steps to work with challenges Joyful Wisdom, pp. 241-248 (Ch. 11, \"Step One: The Main Exercise\")\nDefinition\nKleshas:\nIn Sanskrit,&nbsp;kleshas&nbsp;refers to mental or emotional states of mind and is often translated as \"afflictions,\" \"defilements,\" \"negative emotions,\" or \"poisons.\" The most common kleshas are the five of ignorance, hatred (aversion), craving (attachment), pride, and jealousy.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.3 Transformation and Emotion Meditation\" data-href=\"3.3.3 Transformation and Emotion Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.3-transformation-and-emotion-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.3 Transformation And Emotion, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.3 transformation and emotion, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (50 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(50_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transformation and Emotion: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transformation_and_Emotion_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (12 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(12_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.3-transformation-and-emotion-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.3-transformation-and-emotion-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475949,"modifiedTime":1759272587746,"sourceSize":9195,"sourcePath":"1.

Try to be aware of that. See how your mind changes reality. Or if you want to go to exercise, to meet friends, to a party, or to enjoy a place, and you use a motorcycle or bicycle, you feel very happy on your bicycle. Your body becomes lighter, doesn't it?\nOr if you are cooking for your friend, you feel very happy. You really enjoy each piece of all the dishes, and you feel a lot of excitement. \"How will it taste?\" But if you are cooking the same thing every day, you will feel bored. The moment you enter the kitchen, \"Gosh, I need to cook again.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] See this, and you can work with it. For example, cooking. If you want to cook every day but feel bored, accept impermanence, the pieces, and interdependence. Try to look. Try to cook something new. Every day you should try a dish that is a little bit new. Explore something meaningful that is good for your health and has good taste. Change, innovations, and creativity really help you to be happier and more connected with yourself. Or think about cooking for your friends and family and wanting it to help your friends and family members. That has a sense of meaning. Or cooking healthy food also has a sense of meaning. You can change in that way, too.\nThat is really important for everyday life, and also you can apply this in your workplace. If you feel bored and that every day is the same, try to do something new to help you work better. Even the way you walk to work. Try to explore different paths every day. That helps also. Refresh your brain, your mind, your feelings.\nOr, at home, maybe you have this boring relationship, you know? Husband and wife, girlfriend and boyfriend . . . You can try to learn from each other. Try to do something new together. Try to explore. That is also good for relationships; they become longer actually. I have heard of a lot of research about this also.\nSo bring this wisdom into your life, and it will be good for your happiness, success, peace, and it will also help to free you from suffering.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a few moments to reflect on an area of your life which you would like to bring a fresh perspective to. This could be with a particular person, or while performing a specific task. Once you have chosen an area, set the intention to try something new in this experience. While performing this exercise, remember the principles of multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence. See if they can inform a new way of interacting. At the end of the day, check in to see how the practice went. If it is supportive, record your experience in a journal or another modality of your choice. Over time, these processes can help slowly transform old habits that lead to suffering into new experiences infused with increased well-being.Journal Reflection Questions\nIs being with or analyzing the sense of self easier on the cushion or in your daily life?

This is Antonia. One of the really wonderful things about all of us is that we have the ability to not just perceive but also explore our perception, to be aware of what it is that we are perceiving and how we are perceiving. And one of the things we have been looking at here is how we can have an unhealthy sense of self, what it is that it is made up of, and also how we can move towards a healthy sense of self and begin to live in a way in which we are embodying impermanence, embodying multiplicity, and embodying the understanding of interdependence. Through this, we also start to see more about suffering and how suffering arises and is experienced in our life.\nAnd in this module we will be looking more closely at perception. We will be looking closely at how it is that we are constructing the world that we are living in and how, by becoming aware of how we are interpreting all the time, we can let go of some of the interpretations that are not so helpful, that are actually creating suffering. And we can begin to perceive the world, ourselves, and others in a way that is more aligned with how things are, but also in a way that is not creating so much suffering.\nIn this module, we will be talking about how we can transform suffering by moving closer to our own experience and actually seeing what is going on, rather than just going with maybe some habitual interpretations or following different habitual patterns. This is a module that is really exciting because we get to look at this very, very closely, and we really start to see how it is opening up a world that is very rich — with an inner richness but also an outer richness.\nAgain, I wish you some interesting exploration, and I look forward to hearing how it is going for you. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.4 Transformation and Suffering View\" data-href=\"3.3.4 Transformation and Suffering View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.4 Transformation And Suffering, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.4 transformation and suffering, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Transformation and Suffering (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Transformation_and_Suffering_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475929,"modifiedTime":1759272587764,"sourceSize":2473,"sourcePath":"1.

When we face suffering honestly, the energetic power that dukkha has over our life eases up, and the bad news of suffering transforms into the good news of liberation.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nWhen you really see the causes and conditions and their interdependence — the true relative level — it really helps. It helps us and becomes a cause of happiness.\nNot seeing this is one main cause of what we call \"suffering,\" unhappiness, or for me, panic, and sometimes depression. Some people have low self-esteem, and stress is the main thing right now, right? Because of stress, we do not really see the pieces, so we become lazy. We cannot enjoy change, the interdependence, and we say, \"I will do it later.\"\nThere is scientific data that says that normally in our lives, we spend most of our time on something other than the important things. You spend time and effort on the important things just a little bit. If you do not pay attention, then you will have stress, of course. \"The deadline is almost here!\" Therefore, the main cause of suffering is, as you know, that there is the unhealthy sense of self and the healthy sense of self, and these two do not agree with each other. The unhealthy sense of self says, \"Me first! Do not care about others,\" for example, right? And the healthy sense of self says, \"I like to help, I like to connect, I like to change, I like to have freshness, I like having something new. I like to have creativity, I like to connect with people. I like to have friends and family, to be social, and to help.\" But then the unhealthy sense of self says, \"No. Stability is better. If you try something new, who knows? It is dangerous. Do not do that, do not even think of it.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Right? And these two are fighting.\nThen, if you follow the unhealthy sense of self, it looks like you achieve something — temporarily. It looks like you are successful. Actually, this success comes from wisdom, compassion, and awareness — not from the unhealthy sense of self. Normally, we say that within each klesha, or negative emotion, there are good qualities. But you do not know that, and you give credit to the unhealthy sense of self. \"Yeah, I have to win first. Only I can win.\" But actually, that is not really helping you, especially in the long term. But you can follow the healthy sense of self. You can try that. Do social work, and you will feel very happy on a deeper level. You will feel like, \"This is me, this is who I am.\" It will feel like coming home. Why? You are closer to your true nature. You are closer to who you are. And helping your friends and family is also good for you, isn't it? Helping other people is a win-win situation. For the long term, that is better. That becomes a cause of happiness and a cause of success.\nNow here, we will bring awareness to the self, and what you will discover are five experiences. Try this. Look at — you know already — the sense of \"me, me, me.\" You can look at it with the resting style; you do not need to ask any questions. Just feel the \"me, me, me\" and observe it. You do not have to control it, you do not have to create \"me,\" and you do not have to suppress \"me.\" Just be with it. Or ask questions. If you like analytical meditation, ask questions.\nWe will do this together. First, please keep your spine loosely straight, and rest your mind in open awareness meditation.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please be with the sense of \"me.\" Observe the sense of \"me,\" or ask questions. \"Me, me, me.\" Where is \"me\"?\n[Silent meditation]\nYou do not need to control, suppress, or get rid of \"me,\" or make or create \"me.\" How nice! Do nothing. Just witness it. Just be with the sense of me.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in open awareness again.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice Begin session Begin by finding a comfortable body posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease and relaxation.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.\nNext, take a few deep breaths. On the exhalation, simply let be, and rest in open awareness. Main practice First, take a few moments to bring to mind an area of your life where you feel contraction, uneasiness, or agitation. This could be while performing a particular task at work, or engaging with a difficult neighbor.\nNow, be aware of the sense of self within this situation. For instance, you might experience a sense of self that is suffering, or you may experience inferiority of some kind. Be with the solid sense of self in this experience. If you find it more helpful to ask a question, you can do so. For example, ask yourself, \"Where is the sense of self within the situation?\" There is no need to manipulate your experience or search too much. Just look with the gentle touch of awareness and be with what you find.\nIf you notice that your mind gets agitated, that the practice is too overwhelming, or that you are trying to get rid of a certain experience, just drop what you are doing, and rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nOnce again, bring to mind this challenging situation, and notice any resistance that you experience. Within this resistance, you might notice a \"booster\" of some kind, such as fear or anger toward yourself or another person. Ask yourself, \"What is the sense of self that is fueling jealousy, pride, attachment, aversion, or ignorance?\" See if there are beliefs or concepts present. If it is helpful, investigate these concepts or beliefs with the three principles of multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence. See if you are grasping at a singular, independent, and permanent self. End session Now, let go of any inquiries, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains that embodying a healthy sense of self becomes a real cause of happiness. This is because we begin to feel like we are coming home. Does this feel accessible to you? Please explain why or why not.Do you experience a difference in practicing with the resting style compared to the analytical style? If so, describe the difference.Tip\nWhen you understand the causes of your own suffering, you will be able to extend this insight to include the suffering of others.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.4 Transformation and Suffering Application\" data-href=\"3.3.4 Transformation and Suffering Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.4 Transformation And Suffering, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.4 transformation and suffering, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transformation and Suffering: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transformation_and_Suffering_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475919,"modifiedTime":1759272587771,"sourceSize":7647,"sourcePath":"1.

The same is true with a master of the mind. The more rigid our sense of self, the more surface we provide for the arrows to hit.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe two types of suffering\nhow to transform suffering into wisdom\nexamples which illustrate the main cause of suffering\nhow to work with problems in life\nWatch Read\nHow to work with wisdom and suffering? \"Suffering\" refers to problems that you encounter in your life. How to work with these problems with wisdom?\nNormally, there are two types of suffering. I have mentioned this before. They are what we call \"natural suffering\" and \"self-created suffering.\" Self-created suffering is connected with the unhealthy sense of self. The \"me, me, me\" is too touchy, too sensitive, and we do not see the nature of reality very clearly because of the concepts of singularity, permanence, and independence. In that case, the suffering is very severe actually, very painful, and we are not happy.&nbsp;\nBut then there is natural suffering, which is related to the healthy sense of self, in what we sometimes call \"relative truth\" or \"relative reality.\" There are two kinds of relative reality: fake relative and true relative. \"Fake relative\" means it does not even exist at the relative level. It is just like seeing a mirage as water. You see a mirage as water, but there is no water at all; it is just a mirage, right? Or it is what we sometimes call a \"double moon.\" There is no double moon in the sky, but you can see it very clearly.\nThis self-created suffering comes from how we look at things, our beliefs, and how our mind, feelings, and perception are colored by this permanent, singular, and independent view or feeling. That influences us.\nThis does not even exist on the relative level, but what does exist on the relative level? The true relative, meaning that you are changing. Can I tell you something? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I will tell you some not-good news. If you want to hear it, raise your hand. The not-good news is that you are getting older every second. That is true. And for that, what do we need to do? Accept it. You cannot change it. Then what can we do? Accept it. And there are a lot of pieces. You cannot control them. You have to connect all these pieces. Life is interdependent. You have to accept that. These principles are what we call \"true relative.\" Sometimes we are sick. We are getting older. And there are earthquakes sometimes. There are diseases. Right now, we have a global pandemic. That is true. And there are fires. In many different parts of the world, they are having fires. That is true. And there are floods. All these are there.\nBut, what we normally call \"suffering\" is a mental state. You are getting older. Whether you want to be getting older or not depends on how you look at it. In Asian culture, especially in my generation when I was young, becoming older was very nice. Elders were respected by everybody. Being an elder meant having more experience, more knowledge, and being more learned. This was for the Asian culture. Now, not so much — it is changing, it is impermanent. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But when I come to the West, people do not like it. They do not even want to talk about getting old. So how you look at it forms the perception in your mind.&nbsp;\nMaybe I will give you an example. When the physical body is too hot, that is not good, right? If it is too cold, that is also not good. But this is true relative. It is true. It is too hot because of causes and conditions. Or it is too cold — also true. Because of causes and conditions, you may become too cold. But whether being too hot or too cold becomes suffering or unpleasant or not depends on how you look at it. It is in your mind. It does not exist on the level of phenomena itself.\nFor example, some people do not like to be too cold. Or some people do not like being too hot. Do you want to be too hot? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] How many of you do not want to be too hot? Raise your hand. Maybe you do not want to be too hot, and in the summertime, you are going out and the weather is very hot. \"I cannot breathe now.\" And you walk outside, and there is humidity, and you are sweating. You have one or two drops of sweat, and you might feel like, \"I am going to die, right now.\" It is very uncomfortable, and you complain about the weather. You are walking, and you go to the gym. You go to the gym, take a shower, and you really want to go to the sauna. Then you go into the sauna, and the sauna is very hot. But now you feel very happy. \"Ahh, I am a member of this gym, I pay every month, so now my money is becoming useful. I am doing something.\" And you are waiting for the heat. If it is not hot enough, you put more water on the rocks. You want more heat. And you are waiting to sweat, you know? The doctor said that if you sweat, it is good for your health. Then when you sweat, you feel so happy. \"Wow! I am alive.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But actually, the heat is the same, right? If the heat is outside, you do not like it. Actually, there is a free sauna outside, but you do not like it. Now here, you pay for this sauna. And you need to make a special schedule for this sauna. The heat outside cannot compare with it. The sauna is much hotter than outside, but you feel happy. Right? So, it is in our mind, on the mental level, and depends on how we look at it. Also, maybe some of you do not like being too cold. How many of you do not want to be too cold? Raise your hand. Okay. Maybe in winter, it is cold and there is ice everywhere. You go outside, and even if you wear a thick jacket, you are cold. And if one or two drops of rain fall on your head, you might think, \"I am going to die now.\" But then you go to the sauna, and after finishing the sauna you jump into the cold water and feel very happy. Or you take a cold shower and feel very happy, right? This is the difference between self-created suffering and natural suffering.\nAlso, there is another story about some people who want to go to the gym, and they are fighting for a parking space. They want to park their car next to the gym because they do not want to walk. If they cannot find parking near the gym, they park their car far away, and they have to walk. And they complain, \"Today I have bad luck,\" or, \"These people took my space.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] And you walk into the gym, and what do you do? You walk on a machine. Now you feel very happy — each step is happiness.&nbsp;\nTherefore, although \"too hot\" or \"too cold\" is true relative, whether it becomes a cause of suffering or not depends on how you look at it. Everything is interdependent.&nbsp;\nNow, here, the really important thing is the main cause of suffering, which is that we do not really understand the unhealthy sense of self. Sometimes you cannot control things, so you have to accept that you cannot control them. It is changing, and we need to accept that it is changing. It has a lot of pieces, causes, and conditions, and we have to accept that. When we accept that, we feel happier and freer.\nIf you have a problem in your life, ask yourself one question: do you have a solution or not? Or, do you know the solution or not? If you know the solution, if you have the solution, there is no need to feel bad. It is okay, right? If you do not know the solution, if you do not have the solution, feeling bad is not beneficial. Accept it, let it go, but do not give up, right? Try your best to look for pieces and how these are connected to find a solution. And wait for time to pass. As I mentioned before, you may not cross a dead-end road where there is a huge wall in front of you. You may not cross it that way, but there are other ways you can cross.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the main cause of suffering depends on our perception and shares an example of how aging is perceived differently across cultures. In this regard, how would you explain the idea of you putting yourself into a self-created prison? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche says that the strategy to work with problems is to apply the three principles of multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence while directly examining the nature of phenomena. Please explain how this works. Points to remember:\nSuffering is categorized into natural suffering and self-created suffering.\nSelf-created suffering is caused by our beliefs and perceptions.\nSolutions to problems can be found by applying the principles of impermanence, multiplicity, and interdependance.\nThe root of suffering is not seeing the true nature of phenomena.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow problems can become opportunities\nhow to recognize resistance or fear underneath main emotions\nan important strategy to keep your practice sustainable\nthe last two of the four steps to work with challenges Joyful Wisdom, pp. 248–252 (Ch. 11, \"Step Three: Step Back\")\nInquiry\nAre you able to recognize your own perceptions as perceptions?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.3.4 Transformation and Suffering Meditation\" data-href=\"3.3.4 Transformation and Suffering Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.3.4 Transformation And Suffering, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.3.4 transformation and suffering, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.3.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (50 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(50_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Transformation and Suffering: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Transformation_and_Suffering_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.3/3.3.4-transformation-and-suffering-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800475903,"modifiedTime":1759272587787,"sourceSize":9969,"sourcePath":"1.

Yet here we are, alive in this wondrous world of appearances, which can always benefit from wise discernment.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nConclusion by Mingyur Rinpoche Read\nCongratulations! Another course is now finished. Of course, everything is impermanent, isn't it, at the relative level? The course is impermanent; it is finished. But impermanence does not mean the end — there are a lot of possibilities there. We will have the next course later. In this course, you really went to the heart of emptiness, the heart of yourself, who you are. You are emptiness.\nActually, for me, that answer really answers everything. Sometimes, I have a lot of questions about my life, who I am, and where this whole universe came from. When I was young, I had a lot of interest in cosmology. \"Wow! The sun, moon, galaxies — where did they come from?\" I had a lot of discussions with a lot of scientists and physicists. After cosmology, I had a great interest in physics. And then neuroscience. And now psychology. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] And in all the sciences, the more you look at things at a detailed level, a deeper level, the fuzzier they get.\nIn physics in general, there are a lot of rules. It looks like everything is okay. So they thought that once they knew the velocity, etc. — I do not know much about physics so I will not tell you all the details — then they could predict the universe, once they knew everything. But then when they look at things at a more detailed level, there are no rules. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You cannot apply the general rules of the gross level; it is totally different. And now, you even cannot find it at a subtle level. Time, space, and energy collapse. One of the physicists said that in the end, you cannot really find it. It loses meaning; it collapses. So then I made the joke, \"Physics collapses,\" and they said, \"Yes, of course.\" And Buddhism also collapses. Meditators collapse. But at the meditation level, remember that if you do not see, not seeing is the best seeing. Nothing is everything.\nThis is finished, and in the next course, we will do further practice on the possibility aspect, the clarity aspect, the \"ness\" aspect, and how to bring emptiness into your life at the perception level.\nSee you soon! Conclusion by Kasumi Kato Read\nHi, everyone! This is the end of this course. It is wonderful that you have completed it. Thank you so much for sharing your insights in the forum and the webinars. Your questions also helped us to clarify teachings and practices, and we were able to learn from each other.\nThese teachings reveal some old, underlying assumptions that we have, and we cultivated the ability to let go of limiting beliefs about who we are and how things truly are. Perhaps you feel more confident or comfortable in your own skin than ever before. Or perhaps you had a glimpse of it, and yet it was so brief that you feel longing for it. Or you might have more questions than before about who we are. Please do not worry. As Rinpoche says, \"Our meditation path is up and down.\"\nWhen I first learned these teachings, I remember that I was so irritated by the teachings because my solid sense of \"I,\" or identity, was in question. But on the gut level, I felt that I needed to keep going because the truth of the teachings was beneficial to finding freedom within the suffering. Again and again, I truly appreciated the view that Rinpoche often teaches — that meditation is about self-discovery, not self-improvement, that all we do is recognize what has always been within us.\nI hope that you continue to walk the path of meditation. Good luck on your journey. Conclusion by Edwin Kelley Read\nHello again. Hopefully by now, you are beginning to have some experiences of your mind that is free from fixation, free from concepts.\nWhen I first began to have these types of experiences, I was surprised at how troubled I was by the prospect of no concepts. There was a visceral reaction of desperately wanting to make sense of my experience, to analyze what was happening and understand what was happening. Otherwise, how would I know what was going on? It was kind of weird.\nIt took some time, and further practice, to become more at ease with just resting in awareness itself, without the need for it to collapse into being anything, or something in particular — something that I knew, something that I was comfortable with, or anything at all for that matter.\nSo I would encourage you to persevere with your practice, and hopefully you too can learn to be more at ease with the unknown, the ineffable.\nIn the next course, we will explore this luminous, knowing, clarity of our mind in greater depth. This is the last time you will see me as a guide in Joy of Living. Thank you so much for coming along on the journey. It has been a great pleasure. I have really enjoyed it.

Now, we will learn about the self beyond self, or what we sometimes call \"luminous self.\" Another way to say it is \"absolute reality.\" That is the real nature of who we are. When we learn about the self beyond self, we have to know the healthy sense of self. It is really important. The healthy sense of self is what we sometimes call \"true relative reality.\"\nWe already learned about the healthy sense of self. Normally, when we connect with the healthy sense of self we will become happier, and we will become more peaceful, calm, and joyful. It will not just help us become more peaceful, calm, and joyful, but also more creative, open, flexible, and things become more meaningful. We will achieve more with less effort, less difficulty, and fewer problems.\nFor example, in the past, for many years I went to many parts of the world, and I met many therapists, scientists, and researchers. I have a lot of interest in modern science, and I had many discussions with them. And when I have discussions with psychologists, neuroscientists, and physicists, what they talk about is all these things — multiplicity, interdependence, and impermanence, that things are changing. There is research about meditation that shows that when we just watch the breath it makes us happier. It helps to reduce stress, depression, and panic. Why? People ask why. But even scientists do not know why. They say, \"Maybe you are connecting with who you are, so you are calmer.\" Of course, that is true, but the main reason is that we know it is changing, that it is impermanent. We know about the pieces, the interdependence. And many therapists ask you to write all of this in a journal because it really helps. One therapist said that keeping a reflective journal really helps. Seeing all the pieces in life really helps. You just talk to therapists, and you feel better. Why? Because you bring awareness to the pieces.\nThe second is interdependence. That is a really big thing in our lives. From interdependence, we will develop love, compassion, kindness, and a sense of purpose and of the meaning of life. All of this comes from knowing about interconnection, or interdependence. Then, with impermanence, we become more creative, more open, more innovative. These are the healthy sense of self, which you learned already.\nNormally, at the relative level, we have to come into the healthy sense of self. But at the absolute level, we need to go to the self beyond self, or luminous self. In this course, we will explore the self beyond self, the luminous self. This is a really important discussion in the next teaching.\nWelcome from Kasumi Kato Read\nWelcome, everyone! I am Kasumi. Along with Edwin, I will be your guide for the fourth course, The Self Beyond Self. You have gone quite deeply so far in the Awakening Wisdom course, and it is really great that you are participating. It really shows how much you are committed to the path.\nWhat you are going to learn, I would say, is one of the most transformative teachings. It is about the heart of wisdom, the way things truly are. In my own experience, when I face certain challenges and end up struggling, often these teachings show me why I am struggling and what I can cultivate.\nAs you move through these courses, please pay attention to your own reactions or responses to the teachings and practices. These moments are so precious because they show you where you might be falling into an old habit. These moments are great opportunities to turn towards the source of wisdom.\nI hope that you enjoy this course. Please note that we would love to hear from you in the forum and webinars. Kasumi Kato grew up in northern Japan. She has received extensive training in meditation and yoga. She is a Tergar facilitator and oversees Tergar's activities in Japan, in addition to translating for Mingyur Rinpoche. She has two master's degrees and currently teaches Japanese at the University of Wisconsin. In her spare time, she loves to travel and spend time meditating in retreat.\nWelcome from Edwin Kelley Read\nHello, and welcome to this next course. It is called \"The Self Beyond Self.\" This is the fourth course of Awakening Wisdom, Joy of Living level three. This marks the halfway point in Awakening Wisdom.\nSo far, we have examined the ways in which we mistakenly believe our world to be permanent, single, or independent. This is what Mingyur Rinpoche is calling our \"unhealthy sense of self.\" It is the various ways in which we misunderstand or misperceive our reality.\nThrough our meditation and inquiry, we have come to more accurately understand how things truly are. They are, in fact, impermanent, multiple, and interdependent — what Mingyur Rinpoche is referring to as our \"healthy sense of self.\"\nYou may have already begun to notice that realigning our understanding with how things truly are is already beginning to diminish or mitigate our self-created suffering. We are more at ease with what's happening and less at odds with the way things truly are. However, this does little to address the natural suffering that is embedded within our reality, such as being born, aging, getting sick, dying, etc.\nIn order to alleviate this natural suffering, we must go beyond our sense of self, whether our healthy or unhealthy sense of self. We must begin to explore the timeless nature of our awareness, awareness that is not tethered to any concepts — awareness that is luminous, awareness that is pure.\nThis is where we are going. So sit back and enjoy the journey. I look forward to seeing you in the forums again. Edwin Kelley first became interested in Buddhism in 1975 when he attended a meditation retreat near Perth, Australia. In 1992 he went to Burma to undertake a six-month period of intensive retreat with the renowned meditation master Chanmyay Sayadaw.\nEdwin became a student of Mingyur Rinpoche in 1998. He moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota with his wife Myoshin in 2009 to help establish the global Tergar Meditation Community. In addition to his work as an instructor, he currently serves as the Chief Financial Officer for Tergar International.

Whatever you see, you see its nature. Form is emptiness. The nature of sound is emptiness, as is that of smells, tastes, sensations, body, subject, object, a phone, a car, food, coffee, an organic vegetable salad, or whatever . . . Pizza!\nMaybe I will give you an example. Imagine if you go to the Himalayan mountains. I went to the Himalayan mountains. Sometimes, in the Himalayan mountains, it is not easy to get modern food, you know? They have potatoes there,&nbsp;tsampa&nbsp;barley flour, butter, cheese, yogurts, and that kind of food. Otherwise, in the Himalayan mountains, it is not easy to get modern food. So, if you go to the Himalayan mountains — maybe you go there by trekking — there is a package of 21 days. After 14 days, you really want to have pizza, but you cannot find pizza in the Himalayan mountains. You really want pizza, and one day you have a wonderful dream in the Himalayan mountains. In the dream, somebody has brought ingredients and implements to make pizza in the Himalayan mountains. And there they are making pizza. You smell the pizza. You go out and look, and one of your tourist friends is making pizza. You are very happy. You say, \"Hi,\" and that person says, \"Hi.\" You ask, \"Do you need any help?\" and that person says, \"Yeah, of course! I want to make pizza. Please help me.\" And you both make pizza. But the problem is that you cannot carry too much in the Himalayan mountains, so you can only make one pizza. So you divide it. Then, you really want to eat that pizza, and you are so happy. You are thinking you want to have a special ceremony to eat this pizza. So you put the pizza on a piece of rock. Maybe you do a pizza offering and pray with your eyes closed. And when you open your eyes . . . the pizza is gone. Why? In the Himalayan mountains, sometimes we have big birds, and these birds can take your pizza. It happened to me. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It was not pizza, but they gave me organic butter and put it in an animal skin that was sewn together, you know? It looked like a basketball. Somebody gave it to me, and I was so happy. \"Thank you!\" I put it on a piece of rock, and while I was talking to that person a big bird came and took it. It was gone! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] My butter was up there, in the mountains. [Mingyur Rinpoche looks and points upward.] I was feeling very sad. But everything is impermanent. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] That may happen in your dream, and you may cry. When you get the pizza, you feel so happy, and when the pizza is gone, you cry. When you wake up, your pillow is full of tears.\nNow, I will ask you a question: is this dream pizza real or not? How many of you say it is real? Raise your hands. How many of you say it is not real? Raise your hands. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Some of you raise your hands. Normally when I teach, some people raise their hands for both. Actually, both are true. The dream pizza is real in the dream. You can see it, you can smell it, and you can hear when the pizza is sizzling. And you can touch it — there is warmth. And you can taste it. You can try a little, and you can taste it. Everything is real in the dream, but at the same time, it is not real. It is a dream. The dream pizza does not have even one single atom of real pizza. There is nothing. Yet, everything. Yet it is there. That is the real meaning of emptiness. The dream pizza is not a real pizza. It is empty, yet you can see and touch it. If you eat it, it is good for your hunger. It has a function. Therefore, this is what we call \"possibility.\" It is clarity; you can see. Everything is taking place; there is interdependence.\nWe have a sutra we call the \"Heart Sutra.\" In the Heart Sutra, we say that \"form is emptiness,\" meaning that the dream pizza is not real pizza. \"But emptiness&nbsp;is&nbsp;[appearing as] form,\" meaning that the pizza that is not real in the dream appears as a pizza. \"Form is not different than emptiness; emptiness is not different than form.\" This means there is no pizza, but what appears as pizza is no different than pizza in the dream. They are one.\nTry to understand that, and try to see that in your life, with mountains, people . . . When you see that, in the beginning you might have a little bit of fear or uncertainty. But eventually, everything becomes so colorful! When you see everything, it does not need to disappear. What will disappear? The grasping. The touchy one who finds it easy to cry, easy to freeze, easy to burn, and easy to disappear. That will eventually disappear, but you will be able to see things very clearly. Love will come, wisdom will come, and awareness will manifest. Try to do that.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the beginning of each day, set the intention to recognize your experience through the perspective of emptiness. To work with this intention, choose a specific aspect in your life — perhaps the sounds you hear while walking down a street, the taste or smell of foods as you eat, or the physical sensations of sitting wherever you are — and imagine that this experience is just like a dream. Next, take time to pause and examine whether or not this sensory experience feels real or true. Are there any aspects of what you perceive that you can hold onto or pinpoint? Alternate this contemplation with resting in open awareness. Remember, if you find this practice challenging to do right now, you can always come back to it later.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhile setting the intention to explore the world through the perspective of emptiness, what reactions do you experience?

Applying this framework of permanence and impermanence, we reflected on how we relate to ourselves, others, and the world around us.\nIn this section, Rinpoche will teach you about how to look at impermanence in a more subtle way. As Rinpoche says, \"Everything is a manifestation of your own wisdom.\" In the process, we do not need to get rid of our unhealthy habits. Instead, the intention is to look at where we get reactive or stuck in a rigid way of seeing things and open up to the way things really are in a step-by-step manner. What we can do is to experiment and continue to question our expectations and assumptions.\nIn this section, Rinpoche will illustrate the process of analyzing impermanence from another angle. Our exploration begins again with curiosity and maybe a bit of playfulness. Perhaps we get overwhelmed by all the problems in our life because they seem much bigger than us. But when we look deep into them, we discover that the sense of self is not that small, but expands. And we can be bigger than the problems, in that we become more confident, open, and wise.

Why do I say \"self beyond self\"? Although, in the view, we went through time and impermanence, in the end, time does not exist, right? Actually, who we are is beyond time, but it is not \"nothing.\" Everything can happen, everything can manifest, within emptiness. Time is emptiness — that means everything is emptiness. I will go through how matter is also emptiness later. Because of emptiness, everything is possible; everything can take place.\nIn a way, the unhealthy sense of self really wants to have permanence. Because our true nature is not impermanent, there is a quality of permanence there. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Your true nature is really stable; it does not change. Your true nature is very grounded, protected. Nothing can destroy it. It is not going to die, either. Why? It is unborn. In order to die, first you have to be born, right? If nothing is born, how will it die? I told you before that you are not getting older. Not only are you not getting older, but you will not die either. All these qualities we&nbsp;want&nbsp;to see, like the permanent aspect — all these qualities are there, but it is not permanent. Permanence is fixed. The quality of permanence is there, but it is also not permanent. Therefore, various things can come.\nOur true nature is neither permanent nor impermanent. This is what we call \"empti-ness.\" \"Empty\" means it does not exist. \"Ness\" means \"manifest\" — everything can take place. And these two are one. Similarly, we say that fire and heat are one and that water and moisture are one. That is true for everything, actually. It is true not just for you, but for the entire universe. When we recognize that, that really helps us to go beyond concept. And we will not get stuck in samsara — \"samsara\" meaning \"circle of suffering.\" So it is the ultimate freedom.\nOf course, you will not have that right now. Do not think about it, okay? Right now, we are on the true relative level. We have time; we are getting older. We have to respect that. There are causes and results. I have to drink water. If I do not drink water, there will be a big problem. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] So I need to drink water. That is the true relative level. Everything exists at the true relative level. Do not try to ignore that. But, when we meditate, we try to have a glimpse of ultimate reality.\nNow, we are going to practice meditation together. Please keep your spine loosely straight, and relax your muscles. Rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, look at the self. \"Me, me, me.\" And first what you see is that \"me\" is changing. There is a different \"me\" at different times. And then look at time. The past, present, and future. In between the past and future, the present is very tiny. In the end, even the subtlest attosecond disappears. It loses meaning.\nThere is no present. If there is no present, then there is no past or future. So, there is no time. You are empty. \"Me\" is empty. Yet, there is a \"me.\" You have a body, you have a mind, you have feelings, you can see, you can hear — everything is there. That is what we call \"ness,\" \"possibility,\" or \"clarity.\" Your body and mind are here, but the essence of your body and mind is empty. It is just like a dream body.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, just rest your mind in emptiness. Some of you can practice emptiness with resting. In the beginning, when you looked at the sense of \"me,\" you could not find it. It is empty. Once you understand the view of emptiness, and you do resting meditation and cannot find the \"me,\" that has become emptiness meditation. This is after knowing emptiness.\nOr some of you analyze. You cannot find the self, yet it is&nbsp;somebody&nbsp;who cannot find it, right? It is not \"nothing.\" There is the one who sees that there is nothing to see. So, it is not \"nothing.\"\nNow, rest in that union of possibility and emptiness. It is the same as open awareness. You just rest in open awareness with the flavor of emptiness. Sometimes, when you rest in emptiness you may not know whether you are resting in open awareness or emptiness. That is great! After knowing emptiness, even if you rest in open awareness, open awareness becomes emptiness meditation.\nOkay. Thank you! 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n150 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;5 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating with Beyond Impermanence\nBegin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture. Leave your eyes open for this analytical meditation.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything right now. Simply be natural.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice Explore the sense of self. Take a moment to notice if there is a subtle sense of a solid, fixed, and enduring self that exists through time.\nNotice your sense of an \"I\" or \"me\" sitting where you are. You do not need to think too much or analyze, but just notice if you are feeling the sense of an enduring self.&nbsp;\nNext, explore the dynamic flow of your experience. For example, notice any changes in your body or sensory experiences. They are in constant flux. There are no good or bad nor right or wrong experiences. Simply notice change as it occurs, with curiosity and openness.&nbsp;\nNow, see if there are any elements of your identity that are particularly apparent in this moment. You might choose an emotional pattern, a relationship, or your career. Notice the changes that have unfolded in this area of your life.\nNext, completely let go, and rest your mind in open awareness.&nbsp;\nWhen you are ready, come back to your body or sensory experiences, and try to notice the subtle changes taking place within each passing moment. You might choose to observe this with the sensations of the clothes touching your skin, the sounds you hear, or the sensations of your breath. As you experience these changes, notice the ungraspable quality of the experience. Whatever happens is perfectly fine.\nNow, let go of the investigation, and rest in open space, within which all change occurs. Awareness itself is&nbsp;beyond; it is not permanent, nor impermanent. It is always there, just like an open, spacious sky.\nThis awareness or sense of presence is beyond time. It is utterly ungraspable. It is simply the openness of experience. Let yourself drop into this openness. Be this open space of awareness. End session Let go of the analytical meditation, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you investigate time by trying to find the present moment in between the past and future, does your experience of time shift?When you investigate time, do you experience fear or resistance to seeing its empty nature?Inquiry\nHow do you experience your sense of self when you recognize the ungraspable aspect of the present moment?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.1 Welcome to the Self Beyond Self Application\" data-href=\"3.4.1 Welcome to the Self Beyond Self Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.1-welcome-to-the-self-beyond-self-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.1 Welcome To The Self Beyond Self, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.1 welcome to the self beyond self, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Impermanence: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Impermanence_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.1-welcome-to-the-self-beyond-self-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.1-welcome-to-the-self-beyond-self-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476263,"modifiedTime":1759272587834,"sourceSize":8459,"sourcePath":"1.

In relative reality, there is false relative reality, which is related with the unhealthy sense of self, and true relative reality, which is related with the healthy sense of self. Now, we will go beyond both — beyond the unhealthy, of course, and even the healthy sense of self.\nNow, I would like to look at the perspectives of permanence and impermanence because when we want to understand the luminous self, the self beyond self, or what we sometimes call \"emptiness\" or \"ultimate reality,\" it is not nothing, but it does not exist. It is beyond concept. That is who we are.\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this course, whatever thoughts, ideas, feelings, right beliefs, wrong beliefs, or unhealthy or healthy sense of self we have does not matter. Everything is a manifestation of wisdom, isn't it? Why? Everything has some kind of truth in it. With all these thoughts, feelings, habits, or whatever, we try to understand our true nature, to sense our true nature — the radiation of our true nature. The problem is if we get stuck in only one aspect. That is the problem. If we get stuck and see the elephant only as a drum, then there is a problem. The elephant is not only like a drum.\nNow, we will look at the permanent aspect. With the unhealthy sense of self, one principle is permanence. We do not want to change. We want to have consistency and stability, and to feel nice and safe, right? And if we are fixated only on that permanence, there is a problem. In reality, many things are happening, and everything is changing and changing. And, every time, we are disappointed, and we feel insecure. We feel fear, panic, and anxiety. So, we come to the healthy sense of self, changing and changing. Quite nice, no? It has creativity, innovation, flexibility, and openness.\nLet's consider something. If the self and all phenomena were permanent, then nothing could happen. There would be only two possibilities. The first is that everything would be frozen. The entire universe would be frozen if it were permanent because permanence is related with time. Time is changing. If nothing changed, if the universe could not change, if you did not change, then everything would be frozen. No cause, no result. Nothing could happen, could it? Or . . . there would be nothing. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Everything is frozen — that is the first option. It is not an option, it is a possibility. The first possibility is that everything is frozen, and the second is that there is nothing. From the beginning, there is nothing.\nWe are not frozen now. I am changing. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I can move. And we are not \"nothing.\" That means there is impermanence and time. Impermanence is much better, right? Which one would you choose? I would choose impermanence. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It gives a lot of possibilities.\nSo, what is impermanence? Impermanence is time, changing and changing. The entire universe is changing. If there were no time, then we would not exist. So, what is time? Past, present, and future. I am getting older. That is the true relative level — we have to accept that, although it is not nice. Sorry to remind you again. The camera is getting older. You are also getting older. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] We are changing with time. \"Past\" means \"gone,\" \"finished.\" The future has not come yet. So what is \"now\"? It is very tiny.\nMaybe we will discuss a year. Last year is gone, finished. It does not exist now. Next year has not come yet and does not exist now. What do we have now? This year. So, let me ask you a question. Does this year exist or not? Of course it does, right? Are you sure? Does this year exist now? I think not. Why? Because in order for it to become a year, we need twelve months. These twelve months cannot exist now.\nWhat do we have now? Right now, as I am teaching, it is September. August is gone. October has not come yet. What do we have now? Only September. So, this year is just a concept — an idea only. Actually, a year does not exist even at the relative level, at the true relative level. It only exists at the conceptual level. There is no year. So, what do we have now? A month, right? September. Do you think September exists? If so, raise your hand. Or if you think it does not exist, raise your hand. Actually, September does not exist. In order for September to exist, it needs at least more than 28 days, right? I do not know exactly how many days are in the Western calendar, but these 28 or more days cannot exist now.\nLet's say today is the 15th. Then the 14th is gone, and the 16th has not come yet. What we have is only the 15th. So a month is just a concept; it does not exist. What exists? Today? The 15th. Does the 15th exist? No. Why not? In order for the 15th to exist, we need to have 24 hours. And 24 hours cannot exist now. Now, I think it is 7 p.m. Nepal time. 6 p.m. is gone, and 8 p.m. has not come yet. A day is a concept. It does not exist. What exists now? 7 p.m. Are you sure 7 p.m. exists? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] No. The 7 p.m. hour has 60 minutes, and these 60 minutes cannot exist now. And these 60 minutes each have 60 seconds. Without all the seconds, the minute cannot exist. Only a second can. Let's say now is the 30th second. Right? [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.] And that 30th second is changing. You are changing, I am changing, and the entire universe is changing within this second.\nNow, we can look at this second. Recently, scientists have said there are \"attoseconds.\" They can look into one second and divide it. The second is to the attosecond what thirty-some billion years is to one second. Thirty-some billion years, compared with one second, is a long time, right? But you can divide it. In the Abhidharma — we have the Abhidharma texts — within one second, consciousness and thoughts change at a subtle level many billions of times. Great meditators can experience it. Of course, we cannot yet.\nThat tiny second exists at the relative level. That is the true relative level. How tiny we are! In a way. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Everything is changing, changing, and changing! [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.] Isn't it? Now you understand what the true relative is. It is changing. A second can be divided thirty-some billion times into many, many small pieces, and those tiny pieces exist. That is wonderful! Normally, when we meditate on that, as we mentioned before, it helps us to have flexibility, creativity, openness, peace, and happiness — all this. Still, there is a problem. The problem is that we are getting older. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Do you want to get older? No, I do not want to get older. We are still trapped in time. Time is changing, and everything else is changing and changing. Sometimes we might have fear, right? Of course, permanence and fixation — forget about it. If everything were frozen, we would not like it; if everything were nothing, we would not like it. If everything is changing and changing, there are causes and results. But we are still trapped in time. We are still trapped in concept, at the subtle level.\nSo, now, what do you want? For the self beyond self, even time does not exist. Sometimes we practice this analytical meditation. When we look at time, the tiniest part of time, the attosecond, is very tiny. Does that attosecond have parts, or pieces? Is the present attosecond connected with the past and future, or not? If that attosecond is connected with the past and future, then that attosecond has three parts: one connected with the past, one connected with the future, and, in the middle, you have \"now,\" the present. When we look into that tiny part of a second, the present, in the end we cannot find it. It loses meaning. So actually, time is a concept. Even the true relative is a concept according to the absolute level. It is emptiness. You are emptiness. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] All phenomena are emptiness.\nI will tell you some good news. Do you want to hear it? The good news is . . . you will not become older. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] How nice. But . . . you are seemingly getting older. Why? Emptiness is not \"nothing,\" okay? I will tell you more about this later. We will stop here now. See you in the meditation.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nTo illustrate the concept of time, Mingyur Rinpoche demonstrates how time can be divided into progressively smaller portions. He explains that even if you understand the principle of impermanence, the problem still remains. What does \"the problem\" refer to here, and how would you explain this to a friend?\nPoints to remember:\nThe two types of relative reality are: True relative = healthy sense of self\nFalse relative = unhealthy sense of self Operating exclusively within the conceptual framework of permanence and impermanence is limited and misleading.\nRecognizing that time is simply a concept is critical to cultivating freedom.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow to explore the concept of time\na traditional Buddhist take on the relationship between the essence of time and/or space and emptiness\nscientific perspectives with regard to time and space The Joy of Living, pp. 86-91 (Ch. 5:&nbsp;\"The Tyranny of Time\")\nDefinition\nEmptiness (Sanskrit: shunyata, Tibetan: tongpa nyi):\nEmptiness does not equal nothingness, but, rather, it is the unlimited potential for anything to take place. Tongpa in Tibetan means \"empty,\" and nyi is a suffix added to a word to express a sense of possibility.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.1 Welcome to the Self Beyond Self Meditation\" data-href=\"3.4.1 Welcome to the Self Beyond Self Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.1-welcome-to-the-self-beyond-self-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.1 Welcome To The Self Beyond Self, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.1 welcome to the self beyond self, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.1 View","attosecond"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Impermanence: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Impermanence_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (8 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(8_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.1-welcome-to-the-self-beyond-self-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.1-welcome-to-the-self-beyond-self-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476245,"modifiedTime":1759272587849,"sourceSize":10747,"sourcePath":"1.

At that point our search for something irreducible finally collapses. In that moment, when we give up looking for something absolute, we gain our first taste of emptiness, the infinite, indefinable essence of reality as it is.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nIn daily life, I think we need to get familiar with emptiness. I would like you to look for what we call \"examples of emptiness.\" There are many — twelve or sometimes more. There are many different examples of emptiness.\nOne is a dream, which I already mentioned. The second is a mirage. Sometimes, when you enter your car you will see that on the street it looks like there is water, right? And you know it is not real, but you still can see the reflection of the other car or the house in the mirage. Although you know it is not real, it looks like there is a car there. Try to remember that all phenomena are like a mirage.&nbsp;\nAnd go to see the moon reflection in a lake if you have time, or in the water. When you look at the moon's reflection in water, it is very clear. But it is not the real moon. Or in the morning when you wake up and go to the bathroom, try to see your own reflection. It looks real, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs] Although you know it is not you, you shave or put on some makeup, you know?\nOf course, these examples are for an intellectual understanding. At the beginning, you just have the idea of emptiness and some experience of emptiness. But at the feeling level, we cannot understand emptiness at the beginning. No problem. Do not worry about that. You will see everything as real from the feeling level. And the third level is what we call the \"perception level.\" You are perceiving things as existent. This is not just at the idea level, there is also the feeling level and a perception level. What you see seems to exist, what you hear seems to exist, and everything you touch. What we call the \"recognition of emptiness\" has to go through these three levels first.\nThere is the understanding level, the experiential level, and the last one, which we call the \"direct realization level.\" When you are at the direct realization level, even your perception changes. You will see everything as emptiness. At that moment, you are really happy on a deeper level, really free, and carefree. But you see a variety of things. You still respect causes and conditions, the dreamlike causes, dreamlike conditions, dreamlike karma or causality. You see that all the interdependent causes together have a result. At the relative level, you still respect all these things. But, at the absolute level, you are free, open, and fearless.\nSo, we have the examples of a dream, mirage, moon reflection, or your own reflection in a mirror. Another is an optical illusion. Maybe sometimes, when clouds move, you can look at the top of a tree, and it looks like the tree is moving or falling towards you. But, actually, the tree is not moving. It just looks like that because of the clouds. You can see things like that. These are also reminders of emptiness. You can look at a rainbow also. It is beautiful. It looks like it is there, but you cannot really grab it.\nTry to get familiar with these examples in your life and see that everything is like that.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nTake a few moments to reflect on your upcoming day. Set an intention to focus on a particular activity, such as brushing your teeth, taking a shower, eating meals, etc. When you engage in this activity, pause and apply the practice of relating to it as an illusion, or like the moon's reflection in a lake. In the evening, take a few minutes to reflect on how it went. Did you remember to apply the practice during the day? Renew your aspiration to continue the practice tomorrow.\nYou can alternate the above practice with periodically recognizing how your sense of self is like a moon reflection. At the beginning of each day, take a moment to set the intention to recognize the ungraspable nature of the self. Choose one aspect of your sense of self to focus on, such as physical sensations, the senses, or thoughts and emotions. Throughout the day, take the time to pause and recognize its illusionary nature.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nAs you engage with the practice of recognizing everything to be like the moon's reflection in a lake, do you feel any change in your lived experience of who you are? Please explain.&nbsp;\nWhat is the biggest obstacle to imagining everything as a moon reflection in daily life? What strategies could you use to work with this?\nTip\nYour resistance to emptiness is in itself the manifestation of innate wisdom.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity Summary\" data-href=\"3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.2 beyond multiplicity, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.2 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Multiplicity: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Multiplicity_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476236,"modifiedTime":1759272587863,"sourceSize":5676,"sourcePath":"1.

I was about halfway into the retreat and was deeply immersed in the investigation of my relationship with my experience, and completely puzzled by how tenaciously I continued to cling to my thoughts, my feelings, and particularly my suffering, both mental and physical. It seemed that this stuff was definitely happening to me. I was so wrapped up in it.\nI could see how my mind kept making all this stuff real. So my practice just became about letting go of each and every experience, one after the other. Slowly, over a few days, lines of a verse came to me, and then I worked for a couple days to refine them. This is what I came up with — my little poem. \"If only these appearances were that solid\nThen I would really have cause for concern,\nBut given their true nature\nWhy should any of them stick?\nWhy not just rest\nWhere there is no hope or fear?\" I had come to see that I needed to go beyond the concepts, to begin to loosen my grasp on things as being solid, real — the identification and appropriation of my experience — to see that nothing was fixed, solid, or separate.\nWe can learn to understand or recognize this, rest with this experience of uncertainty, and then be okay there. This is the true nature of our self, and everything. So, the lesson is to just let go — and we will be fine. It will be okay.\nThank you. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity View\" data-href=\"3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.2 beyond multiplicity, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Beyond Multiplicity (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Beyond_Multiplicity_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476229,"modifiedTime":1759272587868,"sourceSize":2395,"sourcePath":"1.

Remember that when you recognize your dream, the dream does not need to disappear, right? In a lucid dream. You can have pizza, but what disappears is ignorance, the wrong belief that the dream is real, or that the dream appears as real. When you do not know that the dream is a dream, then you are trapped in the dream. Then you need to follow the dream rules. A dream fire will burn you. When you lose your dream pizza, you suffer a lot, right? But if you know you are dreaming, although you see everything and what you see does not change, the way you see things changes. When that changes, what happens? Real freedom happens. You are really free. There is a sense of real confidence, and also appreciation, various things. But at the same time, there is no suffering. You will not be trapped in the dream. That is the result of the practice of emptiness, or self beyond self. And that is who you are actually.\nBecause of ignorance, when we do not recognize our true nature, we are trapped in time, subject and object, and concepts. Then, there is endless suffering, you continue and continue in samsara.\nNow, you understand emptiness intellectually, right? But, from a feeling level, you do not understand, normally. When you look at an avocado, it exists — especially when you are hungry. \"Oh! Avocado would be wonderful!\" And if someone takes your avocado, although you know it is emptiness — the avocado, you yourself, and the person are emptiness — anger comes like the explosion of a bomb or a volcanic eruption. Then, afterward, \"Oops! Why am I angry? The avocado is emptiness, isn't it? I get it, but why am I still angry?\" Sometimes you feel guilty. Do not worry, that is normal.\nHow do we bring this into experience? We have to meditate. So now, we will do this meditation. I would like you to use a dream as the focus of this meditation. See yourself as a dream, although you have a body. You have a mind, but it is like a dream, or what we sometimes call a \"rainbow in the sky.\" You can see it, but you cannot grab it. Or it is like what we sometimes call a \"moon reflection in a lake.\" It is very clear. It looks like the moon is in the lake, but actually, the moon is not in the lake. Vividly present, everything can take place, yet it is empty. Just like the moon's reflection in a lake.\nOkay. Now please keep your spine loosely straight. First, rest your mind in open awareness. Maybe, just resting in open awareness, you will recognize emptiness also. Open awareness meditation becomes emptiness meditation. Wonderful! If not, it is also okay.\nNow, look at the sense of self. Not finding it, that is emptiness. Wonderful! Rest in emptiness. Or you find pieces — your body, your mind. Look at your body or mind. You can look at your body. Your body has many pieces. Which one is \"you\"? Which one is your body? Your head, arms, organs, flesh, bones? All these are parts of your body.\nAnd these parts have sub-parts, like your hand. In the end, there are atoms. Your whole body is made of atoms. The atoms are changing. They are interdependent. All of these atoms, when you look at them at a deeper level, are 99% empty. And the remaining 1% is 99% empty. In the end, you cannot find anything.\nSo, you are baseless. Just like a dream. In the dream, you have a body, but that body does not have one single atom of a real body. Yet it beautifully manifests in the dream. Similarly, you are just like a dream, or a beautiful moon reflection in a lake. Or a rainbow in the sky. You cannot grab anything, yet it is not \"nothing.\" The somebody who is experiencing cannot be grabbed. That is emptiness. Rest in emptiness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n180 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;6 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating with Beyond Multiplicity\nBegin session Begin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to be at ease and relaxed.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest in this natural, knowing quality of your mind. Main practice Recognize your sense of self, and then investigate the multiple components that comprise it. Notice how your sense of self is based in a body made up of many different parts, or how your mind has different thoughts and states.\nThen, ask yourself, \"Is there anything inherently existing in any of these components?\" and see what comes up in your experience. Rest in the empty nature of the sense of self while being aware of how all of these components manifest.&nbsp;\nWhen you recognize the sense of self, allow it to be vibrant and dynamic in how it appears. Again, rest in the empty nature of this sense of self.&nbsp;\nEach time that the sense of self arises, examine the multiple components that comprise it, and look into the empty nature of its appearance. Examine if there is anything you can hold onto among its components. Rest in the ungraspability itself. End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone.

Take \"oneness.\" Our true nature is emptiness, so sometimes you can say it is oneness. There is no difference between subject and object. There is no difference between up and down. Everything is an illusion, so you do not need to get trapped in any sense of direction. Of course, we already mentioned that you will not be trapped in time. You are really free, actually.\nSometimes, I ask people a question. If you go to the Himalayan mountains and have a nightmare, remember? Maybe your dream pizza is taken by a bird. Or sometimes there is a landslide in the Himalayan mountains. Or tigers or bears are chasing after you. Or, in everyday life, you might have bad dreams or nightmares. What is the solution for freeing yourself from this nightmare without waking up? While you are dreaming, how can you be free from the dream problem? Any solution? You can think. I think the best solution is . . . to recognize you are dreaming, like in a lucid dream. That is all! When you recognize you are dreaming, \"Oh!\" You can jump into a tiger's mouth, and it cannot eat you. If a landslide comes, you can jump right under the landslide, and you will not die. You can walk on the ocean without sinking. You can jump into the fire, and it cannot burn you. But the dream will not disappear. You can still enjoy the dream pizza. While you know it is a dream, there is still taste. There will still be smells, but you will not have grasping. You will not believe it is true. You will be free. You will not be trapped by subject and object, time, possessions, and all the elements — water, fire, earth . . . All these different pieces cannot trap you once you recognize it is a dream.\nSimilarly here, we have so many pieces, but if we recognize that they are emptiness, eventually we can free ourselves. But, of course, not right now. So do not try to jump into a fire, okay? [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Right now, if you jump into a fire, you will get burned, of course. The fire exists at the true relative level. At the relative level, we have to respect that until we are totally free. Until then, the laws of the relative level are true. There is cause and result. So impermanence is true; time is true.\nWe can check again through the principle of multiplicity. Our true nature is not one and not many. We already discussed singularity before. \"Me\" is not one, right? \"Me\" becomes \"me\" because of the body, mind, name, title, position . . . Because of your student, you are a teacher. Because of your teacher, you are a student. \"Me\" is interdependent. \"Me\" has so many different pieces. \"Me\" is changing and changing. We all know that, right?\nSo, now we will look at the pieces, at the multiplicity. Look at your body. The mind you can analyze in the same way as with impermanence. In the end, time is emptiness. With the body, it is also the same — you can look at the permanent and impermanent aspects also. But now, I can use a different analogy, which we call \"looking at pieces,\" to go beyond singularity and multiplicity.\nI will ask you a question: where is Mingyur Rinpoche? Where? You can point. [Mingyur Rinpoche points forward.] There, right? \"Mingyur Rinpoche.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche points at himself.] Maybe you are looking around my nose or eyes. Are my eyes Mingyur Rinpoche? They are not Mingyur Rinpoche. We did that last time, right? Is my hand Mingyur Rinpoche? It is not Mingyur Rinpoche. It is Mingyur Rinpoche's hand, right? We also did this experiment. Remember about this? [Mingyur Rinpoche hides his whole body behind his robes, except for his hand.] Can you see Mingyur Rinpoche? You do not see Mingyur Rinpoche; you just see Mingyur Rinpoche's hand. So Mingyur Rinpoche is all these pieces put together. And then there are different functions, different names, and different ideas. So, at that point, we say Mingyur Rinpoche. But then when you look at the hand, the hand has so many pieces. Each piece is not the full hand, but it is part of the hand. You look at the thumb, and the thumb has many pieces, like skin and bones. The bones have many pieces. There are also nails, colors, and shapes. Even the bones have other pieces. Then you will get down to the atom. In the end, after looking at smaller and smaller pieces, everything is based on the atom.\nSo, what is an atom? In our meditation tradition, we say that atoms have subatomic particles. In modern science, many years ago, they thought the atom was the smallest thing in the universe. But 60 or 70 years ago, what they discovered were subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. In our tradition, we have eight or nine subatomic particles. And these are what we call the \"four element particles,\" like form, smell, taste, sensations, and sometimes sound. There is a total of eight or nine particles. And each element has a different function. As for the element particles, the earth is like mass. There is weight — light and heavy. And then wind is changing and changing. Everything is moving. It helps movement. Water is cohesive. Everything is bound together, like with gravity. Gravity, at the subtle level, is also an energy level particle. And then there is fire, which is happening, ripening. All these sub-particles are very tiny, like light. They have different functions but are all together. When we look into that more and more, of course, it is not really a particle. It is like a field. And when we look even into that, in the end, we cannot find it.\nI will explain it to you with modern physics. I met one physicist who is in the top 10 in his field of quantum gravity — in the top 10 in the world. What he said is that when they look at an atom, the atom is 99% empty. It is like the solar system, you know? In the solar system, we have the sun and all these planets. And in between them, there is a lot of space, but they go around and around. Atoms are like that: the subatomic particles move around each other, but it is empty. So, 1% is there, and when we look at that 1%, that is also 99% empty. And the remaining 1% is&nbsp;also&nbsp;99% empty. You go smaller and smaller, and in the end, there is a very tiny . . . Of course, it is like light, a field. There is space, time, an energy curve, and a tiny black hole there. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] I do not understand this. In the end, it loses meaning. But before the atom loses meaning, the difference between the point where the atom almost loses meaning and the atom is like the difference between the solar system and an atom, which is very tiny. In the end, there is no atom. You cannot find one, single atom. Actually, singularity is impossible in the universe. There is no such thing as singularity.\nRight now, we have a global pandemic because of COVID-19, and I grew and took care of my garden. I have a lot of organic vegetables and fruits. [Mingyur Rinpoche holds up a plate of fruits.] This is guava, and this is avocado. These are organic fruits from my garden. Let's say, from the point of view of our meditation tradition, that each of these subatomic particles [Mingyur Rinpoche looks down at the fruits] when we look more and more into it, is not a particle anymore. It is like a field. Even that field has sides or directions. Let's say that the tiny one is in the middle — this is the guava [Mingyur Rinpoche points to the small guava in the middle of the fruits] — the tiniest possible before losing meaning. This is like I told you before, from a scientific perspective. Now, I will tell you from a Buddhist perspective. It almost loses meaning. Does the tiny one have a connection with the other sides, or not? [Mingyur Rinpoche points to the fruits surrounding the guava.] The tiny middle is connected with the front, south, east, west. If these are connected, then the middle becomes five pieces. Then you cannot find one. It has pieces. Once it has pieces, then you have other sub-pieces. It is almost unlimited. So when you look and look into them, in the end, they disappear. The center cannot be found. One cannot be found. If there is not one, how can you have two? It is actually an illusion. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] There are no particles, no atoms. You cannot find them, yet you can have everything.\nSo, \"empty\" does not mean \"nothing.\" I will teach you why we say it does not exist. Because it does not have inherent existence, everything can manifest. If it exists, nothing can manifest. Why? I will tell you in the next section.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nTo illustrate the process of transforming our grasping at solidity, Mingyur Rinpoche asks the question: \"Where is Mingyur Rinpoche?\" He uses this teaching to point out the empty nature of all phenomena. Why is it important to recognize this reality—self beyond self—which is beyond multiplicity? Please explain. Question 2\nIn your own words, how would you describe the illusion-like nature of all phenomena? Points to remember:\nThrough investigating multiplicity, you will eventually see the empty nature of phenomena.\nPhenomena are not one, not many, and not inherently existent.\nYour true nature is already free and liberated.\nEverything you experience is like a magical display.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow to examine the sense of self and identity\nthe importance of bringing the investigation or analysis into a lived experience\nthe power of emptiness practice Joyful Wisdom, pp. 176–178 (Ch. 8:&nbsp;\"The Empty 'I'\")\nTip\nDo not worry if you feel confused. Confusion is a sign of progress.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity Meditation\" data-href=\"3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.2 Beyond Multiplicity, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.2 beyond multiplicity, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Multiplicity: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Multiplicity_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.2-beyond-multiplicity-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476211,"modifiedTime":1759272587889,"sourceSize":10969,"sourcePath":"1.

Let the self-beyond-self accommodate both concepts and no concepts: pain and no pain.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, maybe in the evening, you can look at the moon and try to see a double moon. [Mingyur Rinpoche presses the side of his eye.] Do not press your eyes too much, okay? Not for too long, either. Or you can look at the light, or even a tree, people, or a house. You will see them clearly but double. Also, see everything like a moon reflection in a lake, or a rainbow. Or see it as a magic show — that is another example of emptiness.\nAnd now, one particular thing is especially when you are suffering or having problems, or when something is not going quite as you wish. Or you might have panic — for me it was panic. Or depression, loneliness, or stress. Stress is a big thing. Disappointment, greed, low self-esteem. All kinds of emotions come in your everyday life. Look at who is having them. What I did was asking myself, \"Who is having panic? I am emptiness.\" And look at the feeling of panic itself. Panic is emptiness. So, the panic is empty, yet there is panic. There is a feeling. This is what we call \"suffering in union with emptiness.\" \"Panic in union with emptiness.\" For me, it is really nice when I see panic — it is just empty, yet clear. Vividly present. And then the suffering goes away, actually. You do not mind having panic.\nI will tell you more about this later, but we will begin this now. Begin to try to transform suffering and destructive emotions in your life. Transform them by emptiness. Try this in your life.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nAs you begin each day, set a motivation to remember to practice throughout the day, in particular with challenging situations that reify your sense of an independent self. This often manifests as the belief that we are independent beings, separate from our bodies, minds, friends, situations, etc. The practice in this section is to pause when a difficult emotion arises and ask yourself, \"Who is having this emotion?\" and notice what you experience. If you find this practice challenging to do right now, try picking a different situation which is more workable, or stay with the intention to someday cultivate this ability.\nYou can alternate the above practice with looking at everything as being like the moon's reflection in a lake. Be specific about when you intend to apply this practice, such as while experiencing stress, feeling lonely, panicking, or experiencing grief. When you encounter these situations, the practice is to pause, see the illusion-like nature of the situation, and notice how you view your sense of self within this particular situation.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nDoes the question, \"Who is having this emotion?\" shift your experience or relationship to the emotion?&nbsp;\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that recognizing an emotion in union with emptiness can lead to transformation of suffering into freedom. As you engage in the practice of looking at everything as the moon's reflection in a lake, do you experience changes in how you relate to challenging situations in daily life? Please explain.\nTip\nWhen you feel a strong emotion, let it become the reminder to ask yourself, \"Who is having this emotion?\" and connect with the luminous self.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence Summary\" data-href=\"3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.3 beyond interdependence, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.3 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Interdependence: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Interdependence_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476198,"modifiedTime":1759272587910,"sourceSize":4217,"sourcePath":"1.

This section builds upon the previous ones. It offers us another way to contemplate who we truly are. It is not just something to know or read about, but the intention is to investigate, to see if it is true in our own direct experience and to apply it in daily life.\nRinpoche will show us a magic show with his farm vegetables and teach us about the mind's old tendencies and habits, and how we can transform them. Personally, I am someone who struggles with how I define myself in such a distorted way. I have an old habit of thinking that I am not good enough. And I always look for evidence that confirms my belief. Reflecting on these profound teachings that Rinpoche offers again and again, I experienced how this false, distorted lens was something I constructed and began to see positive things about myself that my beliefs were keeping me from seeing.\nIn this exploration, our perception becomes more aligned with who we truly are. This can unleash the potential that all of us have.

We're not stuck seeing one thing, but rather capable of seeing many possibilities.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, we will do a special meditation. This is connected with an example of emptiness. We have many examples: a dream is one, and another one is a reflection. This could be a reflection of the moon in a lake or your own reflection in a mirror.\nThere is one particular meditation that is not based on the cognitive level. It is just based on sensing, feeling, or imagination. You do not have to worry about if it is true or not. You do not need to analyze. Just be. Just feel it. Okay?\nWhat we are going to do first is close our eyes. And then we will open our eyes naturally. When you open your eyes, look at the space in front of you. Then, let your mind be aware of your peripheral vision, meaning a big view. It is almost like the shape of an egg.\nNow, when I look straight ahead, I can see some parts here, here, up, and down. [Mingyur Rinpoche indicates the outer edges of his field of peripheral vision.] Sometimes I see the tip of my nose also. It looks like a window — an egg-shaped window. And the mind tries to be aware of this view. At the same time, we feel or imagine that it is like a mirror — like an egg-shaped light mirror. A mirror of light, a mirage-like mirror.\nYou need to relax your eyes a little bit. Your mind looks at the right and left. And enjoy the reflection in the mirror. Do not worry about whether it is really a reflection or not. It is just based on a feeling, on imagination, on a sense. Do not worry about the cognitive level, about whether there is a reflector or not. You do not have to worry. And you can blink your eyes. Okay?\nWe will do this together. Now, please keep your spine loosely straight. Relax and close your eyes. And please rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, please, slowly open your eyes. Be aware of the entire view. And this egg-shaped view is like a light mirror. And now, what you are seeing is the reflection in this big mirror.\n[Silent meditation]\nIf possible, do not look at one particular object. It is more like your eyes might look in front of you, and your mind looks right and left. And you can blink, of course. Now, please close your eyes, and rest your mind in open awareness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay.\nHow was it? Sometimes, when we do that, we will experience everything like a reflection. It is like when you go into the mountains and there is a beautiful lake in the mountains. When you look at the lake, it looks like the entire mountain, the valley, and the houses appear in the lake. The clouds and the whole valley are not there in the lake, but it looks like they are there. Actually, all phenomena are just like that — just like a reflection. But we do not recognize that, so they seem so solid, real, and fixed. Therefore, there is grasping, and we may become very touchy, sensitive, and it is easy to cry, easy to burn, and easy to disappear.\nOf course, right now, although you understand that everything is emptiness, at a feeling level, the \"me\" will still burn. Especially if someone says, \"You are stupid!\" [Mingyur Rinpoche raises a clenched fist.] And you think, \"Emptiness? Who cares? I say it is 'emptiness,' but that person is still telling me I am stupid. The words do not go away.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] We will feel like that. That is okay, no problem. Do not worry about it. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating with Beyond InterdependenceWe will explore the practice of going beyond interdependence in four steps: looking (1) at independence, (2) at interdependence, (3) beyond interdependence, and (4) at our experiences as reflections in a mirror.\nBegin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything right now. Simply be natural.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice if there is any sense of the self being independent. For example, you may feel as though a sense of an independent self or \"I\" is separate from what you experience. Is the sense of self or \"I\" somehow separate from what you hear? See if you can notice a sense of an independent self.\nNow, notice any inner experiences that are present, such as sensations in your body, or thoughts or impressions moving through your mind. Notice if there is a sense of independence, or a feeling that you&nbsp;have&nbsp;a body or a mind, or that there is someone who is thinking these thoughts, as if they are separate. Simply notice the sense of independence which separates you from what you are experiencing.\nNext, explore how all of these experiences are intertwined, and notice that the sense of self is somehow the totality of these experiences. Notice the many causes, conditions, and circumstances that are coming together to shape your sense of self. Examine how the one listening to the sounds, or seeing visual objects, etc., cannot be truly separated from all of these different experiences. Simply notice how the one experiencing is utterly interconnected with everything it experiences in this moment.&nbsp;\nNext, examine your body. Contemplate how the sense of self is intimately interwoven with your physical experience, and notice how your body functions in a rich and complex way to make this one moment possible. To make this moment possible, your heart, brain, and every other part of your body work together like a symphony. Reflect on your sense of identity in this moment.&nbsp;\nDrop what you are doing, and rest in open, effortless awareness.&nbsp;\nAs you rest in open awareness, notice the part of you that is beyond your body, mind, sensory experiences, etc. It is open and spacious and allows for all of this to happen. Rest in this openness that is utterly beyond all these interwoven experiences. Simply be that space.&nbsp;\nNow, relate to everything that you see like a reflection in a mirror: insubstantial yet appearing. This is not a thought exercise. Notice your entire field of vision, including your peripheral vision, and recognize that things are not as solid as they appear to be. Just notice this open, ungraspable dimension of experience, and rest. End session Slowly begin to look around, move your body a bit, and notice the subtleties of the world around you. Maintain the sense that whatever you see is just like in a dream, or like a reflection in a mirror. It is appearing, yet there is nothing solid there.\nLet go, and simply rest in open awareness.\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. What happens in your experience when you view or relate to everything as being like a reflection in a mirror?From an experiential point of view, describe the relationship between the experience and the one experiencing it.Tip\n\"Short times, many times\" is the key for allowing these practices to become a lived experience.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence Application\" data-href=\"3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.3 beyond interdependence, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.3 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Interdependence: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Interdependence_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476190,"modifiedTime":1759272587923,"sourceSize":8471,"sourcePath":"1.

In the end, your true nature is beyond both. Your true nature is not permanent, and it is not impermanent.\nPermanence is not nice, is it? It is frozen. Impermanence is much better. Impermanence is actually closer to our true nature, but not quite beyond concept yet. It is still changing. You are still trapped in time. There are still concepts. There is still no real freedom. Actually, your true nature is not even impermanent — it is actually beyond permanence and impermanence.\nIf it is beyond permanence and impermanence, does that mean you are nothing? No, you are not nothing. You have the quality of permanence, as well as the quality of impermanence. Actually, you are both of these combined. I will tell you more about this. You are also not one, and you are not many. You are beyond one and many. You can be one, and you can be many. You are everywhere, and nowhere. This is who we actually are.\nI heard that Einstein said that if someone smokes, and the smoke comes out like this [Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to blow out a puff of smoke], maybe an entire universe can exist in that smoke. Or, an entire universe can exist in a single atom. What happens is that we make everything small. We make everything partial — we divide everything into \"boxes.\" There are a lot of contradictions in these boxes. \"Yes\" is the opposite of \"no.\" \"No\" is the opposite of \"yes.\" \"Far,\" \"near,\" \"up,\" \"down.\" There is a problem, there is suffering.\nActually, you are as big as the universe, but you can be here; everywhere, and nowhere. Of course, we do not experience that now. Now we are at the&nbsp;true relative level. We try to be with the healthy sense of self. When we have a direct realization of emptiness, that moment is beyond time and beyond concepts. Our own perception — getting old, sick, and dying — is like an illusion. Actually, our true nature cannot die. Death is also an illusion. Samsara is an illusion.\nSometimes we refer to \"the union of samsara and nirvana.\" Nirvana does not mean that you can go to a very nice place up there [Mingyur Rinpoche points upward], or to Shangri-La — the place of beautiful flowers, rainbows, precious jewels, nectar-like lakes, or whatever. If you are not free from within, suffering will follow you like a shadow — even in the jeweled, rainbow-like, beautiful flower land. It does not matter where you go. Suffering will follow you like a shadow. But if you really know emptiness, suffering is actually just an illusion, right? When you are free, then everything is free — really free.\nWhen you really recognize emptiness, it does not mean that everything disappears. When you recognize your dreams, dreams do not need to disappear, do they? You can have your dream pizza. But what does disappear is ignorance, believing the dream to be real, seeing the dream as real — that disappears. Then you see the dream as a dream. You can enjoy the dream pizza. When you recognize your dream, you will not have grasping. But you can taste the pizza and enjoy it — no problem.\nToday, the main focus is \"beyond interdependence.\" Independence is unhealthy, and interdependence is the healthy sense of self, right? Our true nature is beyond both. This is actually really important. When we go beyond everything, when we recognize emptiness, everything is possible.\nWe have this example. If you want to write something, you need to have an empty piece of paper. If there is nothing on the paper, then you can write anything. When the sky is empty, everything is allowed [to appear], right? I heard that, without zero, you cannot have mathematics. Likewise, emptiness allows us to happen. Everything can manifest because of emptiness.\nThat is what I want to tell you about today.\nI have a kind of magic show. One, two, three! Haha! These are from my garden. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs and shows two cobs of corn, one tall and white, and the other short and yellow.] I grew these here on my farm. They are organic. Let me ask you, which one is taller? Is the white corn taller, or is the yellow corn taller? If you think the white one is taller, raise your hand. If you think the white one is shorter, raise your hand. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Nobody will say the white one is shorter, right? [Mingyur Rinpoche shows the taller white corn.] The yellow one is shorter. That is objective for everybody.\nBut now, the real fun comes. I have special magic. I will make this one taller. [Mingyur Rinpoche shows the shorter yellow corn.] Without changing anything, I can make this one taller. Okay? This is my power. Ready? One, two, three! [Mingyur Rinpoche shows the yellow corn and a shorter red corn.] Now, which one is taller? See? The yellow one is taller, right? That is my power. How many of you think the yellow one is taller? Raise your hands. The red, brownish one — if you think the red corn is taller, raise your hand. Nobody, right? This is objective.\nOkay, the next one is . . . tall or short? [Mingyur Rinpoche raises the yellow corn on its own.] What do you think? Actually, you cannot say anything. In order for this to become tall or short, it always needs to depend on something else. Why? Because \"tall\" and \"short\" do not exist by themselves. This is not tall. This is not short. It is empty of tall and short. Because \"tall\" and \"short\" do not exist by themselves, sometimes it can be taller, and sometimes it can be shorter. Compared to this [Mingyur Rinpoche shows the longer white corn], it is short. Compared to this [Mingyur Rinpoche shows the shorter red corn], it is tall.\nIt is full of possibilities. Everything is possible because \"tall\" and \"short\" do not inherently exist by themselves. Likewise, this is not just the case with \"tall,\" and \"short,\" but with everything.\nWe have already discussed that this corn depends on its sub-pieces. Those tiny pieces depend on other sub-pieces. Atoms depend on subatomic particles, which depend on other subatomic particles. As I mentioned before, there is no singularity. Singularity is impossible in the universe, actually. Everything has parts. But, in the end, you cannot find even the parts, or something that is singular.\nSo, if there is no singularity, then there is no multiplicity, right? Not one, not many — ha-ha! So, what is this? Who am I? It is emptiness — just like the moon's reflection in a lake. It looks like it is there, but it is not real. With a mirage, you can see a reflection in the mirage. You can see your own reflection in a mirror, or an optical illusion. You can look at the moon. If you squeeze your eyes, then you will see a double moon very clearly, even though there are not two moons there. But you can see a double moon very clearly.\n\"Empty\" does not mean \"nothing.\" This is how we can see through the perspectives of independence and interdependence and arrive at our true nature.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nWe typically categorize things into \"boxes\" based on the belief that they exist independently. In his corn magic show, Mingyur Rinpoche demonstrates interdependence and how, for example, tall or short do not exist inherently in and of themselves but only in relationship to what they are being compared with. Reflecting on this teaching, can you come up with an example from your own life of how the belief that things truly exist leads to suffering?\nPoints to remember:\nThe unhealthy and healthy sense of self are also concepts, belonging to the relative level.\nYour true nature is beyond both independence and interdependence.\nYou can recognize your true nature by investigating the nature of both independence and interdependence.&nbsp;\nEmptiness allows for everything to manifest.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nthe definition of \"emptiness,\" known as&nbsp;tongpa-nyi&nbsp;in Tibetan, and&nbsp;shunyata&nbsp;in Sanskrit\nways to understand emptiness\nhow the basic nature of all experience is emptiness Joyful Wisdom, pp. 114-117 (Ch. 5:&nbsp;\"Emptiness\")\nTip\nWithout emptiness, nothing could happen.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence Meditation\" data-href=\"3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.3 Beyond Interdependence, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.3 beyond interdependence, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (35 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(35_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond Interdependence: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_Interdependence_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.3-beyond-interdependence-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476179,"modifiedTime":1759272587940,"sourceSize":9404,"sourcePath":"1.

We say to see \"the body as a reflection, speech as an echo, and the mind as a mirage.\"\nYou can look at a mirror. Go to your bathroom, or wherever you have a mirror, and look at the mirror and try to praise your reflection. \"Oh, you are wonderful, you are smart, you are kind, you are beautiful/handsome\" — or whatever. Praise the reflection. See what the reflection feels, or thinks, or says. Then do the opposite. \"You are stupid, slack, and nasty.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] It could be whatever you want. \"You are arrogant!\" See what the response is. Does saying these things really matter?\nTry to do that. You can do this whenever you see a mirror or another reflection. And see that everybody is like that. Of course, when I am saying this, it is at the absolute level of course. But for the relative level, we say to \"follow the healthy sense of self.\" So, try to help, to connect, and to do your job of course. You have to work for a living. If you think, \"Oh, my job is emptiness. I will not do my job,\" that is a big problem. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] You still need to pay for things, right? The rent, or whatever. You still take responsibility with regard to your friends, family, life, or whatever. That is totally okay.\nWe have to do that. If you do not do that, you will not really understand emptiness and may become nihilistic. So, these things are there, but they can be viewed as a manifestation or a reflection in a mirror.\nSecondly, you can go to an empty house, to a cave, or in your garage, (Mingyur Rinpoche says \"Hooh\") and there is an echo. Sometimes you can go to an empty valley. I tried this in my village. I received these practices from my father, and I went to an empty village and said, \"OM, AH, HUNG.\" It is a mantra, you know? And then the echoes went, \"OM, om, om.\" You can try it. The speech, the sound, is like an echo. And look at a mirage. When you look at a mirage, it looks like water moving. And that mirage is reflective, actually. It is just like a mirror. It is very clear. You can see things in it.\nThe mind is clear. There is clarity, thinking, moving. And it is emptiness. Try this, and it might be beneficial.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the beginning of each day, take a few moments to set the intention to recognize your body as a reflection, your speech as an echo, and your mind as a mirage. It may be useful to focus on one aspect at a time or, if you prefer, recognize each one whenever the opportunity arises. For instance, with regard to your body, you can look into a mirror, experiment with praising or criticizing yourself, and notice what comes up in your experience. As for speech, you can hear the echo in an empty garage or valley and recognize its empty nature. As for the mind, you can recognize thoughts and emotions as a mirage, recognizing the clarity of mind. Do not worry about trying to have the \"right\" experience. The practice is to see how we are actively constructing the sense of self and to use it as an opportunity to recognize the illusory nature of the experience.Journal Reflection Questions\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche offers a traditional example of recognizing one's body as a reflection, speech as an echo, and mind as mirage. In what area or situation of your life do you find it easiest to relate to your body, speech, and mind in this way?&nbsp;\nWhen practicing recognizing the illusory nature of self, even for only short moments, does it affect how you view yourself as you go about your day?\nTip\nRemember, emptiness also lacks inherent existence.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.4 the Ness of Emptiness Summary\" data-href=\"3.4.4 the Ness of Emptiness Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.4 The Ness Of Emptiness, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.4 the ness of emptiness, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.4 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The \"Ness\" of Emptiness: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_\"Ness\"_of_Emptiness_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476166,"modifiedTime":1759272587957,"sourceSize":4736,"sourcePath":"1.

We can, however, in an experiential way that transcends the ordinary conceptual mind, achieve a genuine understanding of reality as being the union of appearances and emptiness.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow we can look at what we call \"clarity,\" \"awareness,\" or \"luminosity.\" Here, it is more about the one who recognizes emptiness, the one who meditates on emptiness. Of course, the normal practice is the same. We can look at the self, but now we cannot find the self. We cannot find a solid, fixed self anymore, right? We cannot find the self, yet there is a self. A reflection-like self, rainbow-like self, or mirage-like self. Especially for the experiential level, you can look at the self, and you cannot find it. But for the experiential level, it is not nothing. Somebody found out they cannot find it, right? The observer. That is what we sometimes, from the experiential level, call \"ness.\" \"Empty\" means it cannot be found, and \"ness\" means somebody cannot find it. Someone sees that nothing is there. What you see is nothing, but it is not nothing because you see nothing.\nYou can say, \"Oh, I see space,\" but actually, what do you see? You see nothing. \"Seeing nothing\" means seeing space. If you see my hand, you cannot say you see space. Seeing a chair, you cannot say you see space. But if you see emptiness, then you can say, \"Oh, I see space.\" It is the same thing. Sometimes we say, \"Not seeing is the best seeing.\" It is similar to level one. \"Non meditation is the best meditation.\" Here, not seeing is the best seeing. We will try this.\nFirst, please keep your spine loosely straight, and rest your mind in open awareness. Just be. Once you recognize emptiness, maybe just being becomes emptiness meditation — the experiential level of emptiness meditation.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, who is being in open awareness? Who am I? Be with the sense of \"me.\" You cannot really grab it. You cannot find a \"me\" that is single or solid. There is nothing; it is empty. Yet you see that it is empty. So it is not just nothing. There is you. Yet, the essence of you is empty.\nNow, just rest your mind in open awareness meditation.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating on the \"Ness\" of Emptiness\nBegin session Begin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to have a sense of ease and relaxation.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest in this natural, knowing quality.&nbsp; Main practice Look at the sense of self, and be aware of whatever comes up in your experience. Examine if there is anything that you can grab onto as being the sense of \"me,\" or anything solid and independent.&nbsp;\nAs you look at the sense of self, reflect on how there is actually nothing there, but at the same time, there is a knowing quality.&nbsp;\nYou do not need to create any particular experience or look in any particular way, but simply keep observing the&nbsp;looker, or the&nbsp;knower. Again, reflect on how there is nothing, yet there is&nbsp;something&nbsp;knowing that there is nothing.\nNow, look into the sense of self, letting the practice be simple. Contemplate how the sense of self has nothing solid or fixed to it; it is empty. At the same time, there is a quality of knowingness present. Be aware of this knowingness, and simply rest in it.&nbsp; End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone.

We will look at emotions and how we experience them.\nThere are two realities. There is the \"relative reality,\" and the \"absolute reality.\" And in the relative reality, there is the \"fake relative reality\" and the \"true relative reality.\" These are the two.\nThe fake relative reality, as you already know, is the unhealthy sense of self. Single, independent, and permanent. And if our mind holds onto that, what happens? We suffer. It becomes the cause of all the destructive emotions like panic, depression, and low self-esteem. So many different things can manifest — hatred, craving, and so on. And we will not be at peace.\nHow to be free from these emotions? Here in this practice, the main message is that we do not need to do anything. You just be with the unhealthy sense of self, and if you observe that, that is wisdom. Easy, isn't it? We already did that, right?\nWhen you look at the sense of self, what do you find? Maybe you cannot find anything — emptiness, a gap. Wonderful! Or maybe you can find images, voices, a name, your body, an image of yourself, or your mind. You find pieces and the relation of all of these pieces, changing and changing. This comes automatically.\nThen, when we know how our life is related to ourselves and to others, there are so many different perspectives. Normally, we do not know that. We do not know the real level of how it works. When we are closer to our true nature — the true relative level — we actually feel happier, more open, more peaceful, and freer, eventually. But at the same time, we know how to put all these pieces together, how to relate them to each other, and how they change through time. That is the relative level.\nWhen I was in my monastery, I was studying. I was studying Buddhist philosophy, which is very difficult. Some of those topics are really deep. The terms are not easy to understand, and there are big books. I had to read all the books — many books. I felt like, \"Oh, I will never finish all these books.\" So what I did was calculating. I read ten pages every day. By the end of the year, I had read everything. Very nice! I just did it in small pieces. Likewise, you have to be patient, you know. When the time comes, you are done.\nBut still, at the relative level, we are changing. If we are still attached to impermanence, interdependence, and multiplicity, we still have a subtle level of bondage. In the end, everything is emptiness. Time is emptiness. Matter is emptiness. But, emptiness is not nothing. Here, the main topic is that, because of emptiness, everything is possible. I mentioned before that zero is nothing. But because of zero, in mathematics, you can calculate. Without zero, nothing can happen. Space is empty, so everything is possible. On an empty sheet of paper, you can draw anything.\nWhen you understand emptiness, what are the possibilities? There are six possibilities. You can be permanent — and we want to be permanent. Of course, our true nature is like permanence. You can be \"oneness.\" Our true nature is oneness. And you are independent — you are free. You have an absolute level of freedom, actually, in the end. So you can be independent. These are three possibilities.\nBut at the same time, you can have many different pieces and varieties that manifest in so many ways. All of these varieties can be interdependent. They can change. That is also possible. So there are six possibilities — impermanence and permanence, independence and interdependence, and singularity and multiplicity — not just one. The problem is that we get stuck in one. That is the problem. But both are one. That is our true nature.\nThere are a lot of possibilities, and therefore we give it the name \"emptiness.\" In other words, we say, \"Emptiness equals fullness.\" Emptiness equals everything; emptiness equals possibility; emptiness equals potential. This is really important.&nbsp;\nNowadays, many people misunderstand emptiness. It seems like when we hear about \"emptiness,\" we are talking about nothing, but it is not nothing. It is everything. Actually, permanence is nothing. Right? There are not so many possibilities. Impermanence has possibilities, but they are limited. Emptiness is full of possibilities.\nWhen you practice emptiness, there is a journey. Of course, in the beginning, it is just an idea — the understanding of emptiness. Then you practice again and again, and the idea becomes experiential. The second stage is what we call \"experiential.\" You practice again and again, and then it becomes the third stage, which we call the \"direct realization of emptiness.\" So there are three stages.\nThe first stage helps at the cognitive level. This is the understanding of emptiness. The second stage helps at the experiential level. Emptiness is now not just in your head — it comes into your body. In the third stage, even perception changes. It comes into the senses — the wisdom of emptiness comes into the senses — your eyes, ears, nose, and body. When you look at your own body, it is not like now, with this heavy, tiny body that easily gets sick, easily gets cold, and easily feels pain and suffering. It is not like that. It is like the moon's reflection in a lake. Free! We sometimes call this \"emptiness in union with bliss,\" \"emptiness in union with happiness,\" or \"emptiness in union with clarity.\" So, a lot of different experiences will happen. Okay.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche points out that we put ourselves into a prison by reflecting only on the relative reality of permanence and impermanence, singularity and multiplicity, and independence and interdependence. Due to this, we remain stuck in the concepts of time and matter. He explains that the recognition of emptiness brings about infinite possibilities and potential. What do you think the significance of this teaching is, and if you were to explain this to a friend, how might you do so?\nPoints to remember:\nReality is categorized as false relative, true relative, and absolute.\nWe often suffer when grasping at relative reality, whether false relative or true relative reality.\nEmptiness is not nothingness, but full of possibilities.\nThe path includes the intellectual, experiential, and direct realization levels.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nhow clarity allows you to recognize and experience phenomena\nabout the inseparability of the one experiencing and that which is experienced\nabout relative and absolute reality\nTip\nRecognize the illusory nature of phenomena and simply rest within that recognition\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.4 the Ness of Emptiness Meditation\" data-href=\"3.4.4 the Ness of Emptiness Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">View</a>","aliases":["3.4.4.

Introduction","icon":"","description":"Introduction by Edwin Kelley Read\nHello again! This is the last section in The Self Beyond Self. We are calling it \"The 'Ness' of Emptiness.\"\nWhen we first encounter the idea of emptiness, it will probably seem weird. It may also seem quite scary. \"What the — ? If everything is empty, does that mean I do not exist? How can I even experience emptiness if I do not exist? How can I experience anything if I do not exist?\"\nIn the end, what helped me was that even though I began to experience that things did not inherently exist, it was not nothing. I was still aware. I still knew what was happening. This clear, cognizant quality of my mind persisted, even when my mind was devoid of concepts.\nSomehow this practice required me to build trust in the process, even a sense of confidence that I would be okay, that I would not be annihilated. There is a certain skill that comes with practice where we become okay with just resting in the knowing capacity of our mind, without the need to know anything specifically.\nIt is kind of like, even though nothing exists, from that place everything is possible — anything can manifest. There is an infinite potential from which our world and our experiences emerge. \"Wow! I am not doing anything, but look what is happening.\" It reminds me of a little kid learning to ride a bike and wanting to show off, and they will say, \"Look Mum, no hands!\" It is somehow kind of like that. It is just happening. It can be a little scary at first, but slowly, slowly, we develop the confidence to rest in that knowing, without anything being solid, without any handle to hold onto. And it becomes okay.\nSo, persevere, and good luck with the practice. I hope you are doing well. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.4.4 the Ness of Emptiness View\" data-href=\"3.4.4 the Ness of Emptiness View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.4.4 The Ness Of Emptiness, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.4.4 the ness of emptiness, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.4.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing the \"Ness\" of Emptiness (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_the_\"Ness\"_of_Emptiness_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.4/3.4.4-the-ness-of-emptiness-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476159,"modifiedTime":1759272587965,"sourceSize":2359,"sourcePath":"1.

We have finished another course. This course was about what we call the \"ness,\" \"clarity,\" \"appearance,\" or &nbsp;\"possibility\" aspect. Course four is about going beyond the empty aspect. Of course, emptiness and appearance are one, a union. They cannot be separated. But in a way, for the practice, we can either begin with the empty aspect, or we can begin with appearance, or possibility. This course is focused more on possibility, so there is a lot about how to work with emotions and suffering, as well as what possibility is and how everything manifests from emptiness.\nSo, all these courses are finished. The next course is more focused on the union of these two, meaning emptiness in union with possibility, or emptiness in union with clarity. That is what we call our \"true nature.\" Sometimes we also call it \"buddha nature,\" our \"enlightened nature,\" or&nbsp;ka dak&nbsp;in Tibetan, meaning \"original purity.\" That is what we will learn in the next course. Conclusion by Lucas Henriksson Read\nSo, here we are. Congratulations on completing another course. You are getting closer to completing the full Joy of Living series, with only one course remaining. Of course, I use the word \"completing\" here, but it is important to remember, for all of us, that the teachings and practices within this Joy of Living series are not something that we complete, in the sense of the word, but something that simply becomes a deeper and more integrated part of our being the more we study and apply it in our own lives and practice.\nI really like this idea, for lack of a better word, that our study and practice of meditation may start out as something we do, but the more we practice, and the more we apply it in our own life, the more it begins to shift from something we do to who we are. After all, all these practices that we learn here in the Joy of Living series and apply in our lives are not for adding something to our lives but for recognizing what is already there, what is already present within each one of us.\nKnowing that there is a community of people out there that all set aside time in their busy lives and schedules in order to learn and deepen their understanding of their own minds and recognize their own innate potential, who they truly are, in order to benefit not only themselves but also work for the well-being of all is, to me, the most inspiring and beautiful thing.\nThis is the last video I will be recording for this Joy of Living series, and having shared this journey with you, from working with awareness in level one to where we are now, has just been such an inspiration and blessing in my life. So, to all of you, I just want to offer a deep sense of gratitude for being here and being part of this community of meditators, and I hope to continue to connect with you in the forums, webinars, and hopefully, in person one day.\nAll the best in your study and practice. Conclusion by Myoshin Kelley Read\nHi, everyone. Congratulations! You have made it through another course, another chapter, and another tool kit in a certain way — hopefully a tool kit that is supporting you in the sense of being able to know, or taste, something of the wisdom that is inherent within you.\nI think we are getting down to a very profound level of discovery. And sometimes it does not feel that way. Sometimes, it is like, \"Hmm, what is the big deal?\" Or maybe it is still pretty confusing. Just keep going. There is so much in this. As I read the forums, as I see what is happening in your world, it really helps to inspire&nbsp;me&nbsp;to keep going. I feel like a beginner in a certain way, and it just opens me up to what more there is to learn. Especially when you think of infinite potential, infinite possibility, the door is just wide open. And this is what we are embarking on. This is what our lives are, and how we can untie these knots that keep us caught in suffering. Something that is always helpful for me to remember is that what I am really letting go of is my suffering. Then, what is left is this inherent nature that we all have, this luminous self. And it just begins to lighten the way that we live our lives.\nI feel grateful to have made this journey with you, some of you right from Joy of Living Calming the Mind to where we are today. It is such an honor, and I learned so much from you. Deep bows of gratitude to all of you. May this practice lead to the deepening of wisdom within your being that can also ripple out and benefit the world.

What happens when you begin to lose your fear of the people around you and the conditions you used to dread? Well, from one point of view—nothing. From another point of view—everything.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nWelcome! In this course, we will explore more about what we call \"clarity,\" \"luminosity,\" \"appearance,\" or \"perception,\" the phenomena aspect. In the previous course, we focused more on the empty aspect, on going&nbsp;beyond. We focused on&nbsp;how&nbsp;to go beyond concept, beyond subject and object. There is no time — time does not inherently exist. At the same time, neither does matter, self and other, or anything. In the end, the mind cannot grab any of these, but at the same time, they can appear, like the moon's reflection in a lake, your reflection in a mirror, a rainbow in the sky, a dream, or a mirage. When you look at a car, the car is vividly appearing — you can see that the car manifests beautifully — but at the same time, it is empty. That is emptiness. We focused more on the empty aspect in the previous course.\nIn this coming course, we will focus more on the clarity aspect, the possibility aspect. Emptiness is not nothingness. We will look at how everything manifests through emptiness. That will be our focus in this course.\nI am very happy to teach this course, and I welcome all of you again.\nWelcome from Lucas Henriksson Read\nHi everyone, welcome back. This is Lucas again, as you may know by now, and together with Myoshin, I will be your guide for this course on the luminous self, here in the third level of our Joy of Living series.\nIn the previous courses in this level, we have focused on the three characteristics of impermanence, interdependence, and multiplicity building up to where we are now, namely exploring emptiness. In the previous course, the focus was more on the empty aspect of emptiness. As you are probably familiar with by now, emptiness consists of two aspects: the empty aspect, as I said, and then the luminous aspect. The luminous aspect has many names. It is called \"luminosity,\" \"clarity,\" and \"appearance,\" to name a few. And this is exactly what we will be focusing on in this course.\nFor me, personally, connecting with or recognizing this luminous aspect of mind, or, as is our focus here, recognizing emptiness through the luminous aspect, often creates a sense of spaciousness and being at ease, even in the midst of more turbulence that we all experience from time to time in our lives. For me, it also often brings about a sense of joy, recognizing how amazing this mind of ours and also its interplay with the world around us are.\nWith these few words, again, I want to welcome you to this course, and I am really looking forward to exploring this material together with you. &nbsp;See you soon. Lucas Henriksson first met Mingyur Rinpoche in India, in 2008. He spent the next three years pursuing a B.A. in Buddhist Philosophy and Tibetan language in Kathmandu. After his studies, he moved back to Sweden and spent more time in solitary retreats between 2012 and 2015.&nbsp;\nLucas lives in the countryside of Sweden. In his work for Tergar International, he writes content and curriculums for the Joy of Living, Path of Liberation, and Vajrayana Online programs.\nWelcome from Myoshin Kelley Read\nHi, everyone. Welcome to this course on self-luminosity. I am Myoshin, as you may recall, and we again will be joined by Lucas as we go deeper into these teachings on wisdom — as we really begin to come back, come home, to the inherent wisdom that is within us. Again, I am just delighted and honored to be here. Reading your comments in the forum and hearing about your practice, and what you are seeing and experiencing, truly touches me. And it brings it home and inspires me to want to do this practice.\nAnd so, in this course we will be working with the union of emptiness and clarity. In the last program, we were looking at this element of emptiness, where nothing inherently, independently exists. And now we are taking it to the place of understanding more deeply the \"ness\" aspect of emptiness and clarity — that even though it is empty in essence, it still appears.\nTo me, this is a teaching that brings to light the joy, the lightness, that is there when we can really allow this full richness of everything that is appearing, without fear — and be within this. I find myself speechless with this. The glue comes off, the stickiness is not there, and yet it appears. With that, we will find what we do and how it impacts how we live. And that is the discovery.\nThis is something that on one level is so hard to conceptually know. But, at the same time, when we just have faith, trust, and confidence in sticking with these practices and following the teachings that Mingyur Rinpoche gives, it can transform our lives.\nAnd so I look forward to seeing you online in the forums, just to hear what unfolds for you. And know that it is not always easy, it is not always joyous, it is not always fun, and it is a bit confusing at times. And yet it is worth hanging in there. See you soon.

And when you experience it, there is no \"Now What?\" You just get it.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nFor the application, I think you need to appreciate how everything is taking place out of nothing. It is amazing, isn't it? Actually, because of emptiness, everything is possible: there are causes, results, conditions, interdependence, and change. If the nature of all of us were not emptiness then we would either be nothing or frozen, fixed. We are not nothing, and we are not frozen — such a variety of things can manifest from emptiness.\nIn your life, go back to your body, especially. When you feel your body, you can feel your body and emptiness together. You can feel the sensation in your body. You do not have to change the sensation; you do not have to block the sensation. You can have sensation fully, yet the sensation is empty. This is emptiness. It is an empty sensation, in an emptiness body. Appreciate that.\nAnd look at the world. There are trees, rocks, mountains, and houses. All of these are interdependent and changing through emptiness. In the healthy sense of self, we are stuck on time and pieces. But now, not even the pieces or time truly exist, so everything can manifest. Enjoy that!\nSometimes I go to the top of a mountain and look down. I see people. I see that people are busy and dogs are barking. I see houses and mountains. Sometimes compassion automatically comes because people do not know that the nature of the phenomena is emptiness. And sometimes great appreciation comes. \"Wow!\" With emptiness, everything can take place, such as the seasons: winter, summer, autumn, etc. Try to appreciate that all phenomena are one with emptiness.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nTake a few moments to reflect on your upcoming day. Set an intention to focus on a couple specific activities, such as walking, cooking, or reading. When you engage in these activities, pause and examine physical sensations, and recognize a sense of openness or space within which physical sensations arise and dissolve. In the evening, take a moment to reflect on how it went, rejoice in the fact that you practiced, and renew your aspiration to continue tomorrow.&nbsp;\nYou can apply the above practice with other sensory experiences, such as smell or taste, or with the experience of phenomena such as trees, houses, smart phones, etc. At the beginning of each day, take a moment to set the intention to recognize the ungraspable nature of experience. For this, focus on a specific experience, such as that of breathing, talking with friends, or feeling the contact of the floor. Take the time to pause and recognize its ungraspable nature.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nIs it easier to recognize the ungraspable, empty essence of experience with physical sensations than with other sensory experiences? Share your experience of why or why not this is the case.&nbsp;\nHow does recognizing the ungraspable nature of physical sensations affect your relationship with your body? Please explain.\nInquiry\nWhat happens when you perceive your body as a manifestation of emptiness?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.1 Welcome to the Luminous Self Summary\" data-href=\"3.5.1 Welcome to the Luminous Self Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.1-welcome-to-the-luminous-self-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.1 Welcome To The Luminous Self, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.1 welcome to the luminous self, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.1 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Appearance and Emptiness: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Appearance_and_Emptiness_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.1-welcome-to-the-luminous-self-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.1-welcome-to-the-luminous-self-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476435,"modifiedTime":1759272588033,"sourceSize":4072,"sourcePath":"1.

Welcome to this section. Here, we are going to explore the union of emptiness and clarity. And, as I mentioned in the introduction, this is the aspect of wisdom with which we start to feel that freedom, that lightness of being, and we start to come in contact with this limitless potential.\nWe are going to start, with Mingyur Rinpoche, with that which is pretty solid, pretty dense, and that is the body. We are going to bring together the body and emptiness. And so, with that, it is just being able to find the way to not be blinded by the appearance of this body — to not to be solidified and caught in the density of this body.\nI just want to say that, in my own life, I have had a lot of ups and downs, particularly earlier in my life, around health issues. And it really is this sense of being able to allow this to&nbsp;be&nbsp;and not to be broken by it, not to be defeated, not to collapse into this. And through this — through not being sucked into it in a sense, but allowing it in its full vibrancy, even when it is unpleasant — we can find that our lives change, that there is a different way of being with all of this that is not so confining.\nOf course, it is not always so easy, and it is not always evident. We will get stuck over and over again. Yet being able to open to the fullness, the richness, and the dynamicity of being in this body, being with this mind, and finding this infinite potential is something that we can begin to get a glimpse of.\nI look forward to hearing from you in the forum and seeing how it unfolds for you. And I want to say that even in these moments when you feel like you are really struggling with this — it could be right there that you see the union of emptiness and clarity because that is all-embracing. It is all here.

This essential nature of our lives is unborn—like space itself.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow we will do a meditation practice that we call \"emptiness of the body.\"\nThere are the four foundations of mindfulness: mindfulness of the body, feeling, the mind, and phenomena. This is taken from the early teachings of Buddha. Buddha discussed that. When Buddha gave a teaching on Vulture Peak mountain, the second big teaching, Buddha mentioned the emptiness of the body, feeling, the mind, and phenomena.\nNow, I think we will practice. The main practice here is the emptiness of the body, but it also has the flavor of emptiness of feeling, the mind, and phenomena. All are in one. Especially for emptiness of feeling and the mind, we will focus on emotion meditation. Here, we need to practice how \"me\" is based on the combination of the mind and body. This is the case especially when we focus on the body, and of course, it is the same for the mind. We say, \"By knowing the general nature of one phenomenon, you will know the nature of all phenomena.\"\nFirst, we need to feel the body. Scan the body, feel it, and relax the muscles. Then we go deep into the body to see the pieces. The body is constructed by all these pieces. And these pieces are changing, moving, and are interdependent. And then, those small parts also have different sub-parts. Then there are atoms and subatomic particles, which in the end lose meaning. Time loses meaning, particles lose meaning. The entire body is baseless, yet you can have a body. It is from emptiness that the body manifests, like the moon's reflection in a lake or your own reflection in a mirror.\nYou have what we call an \"enlightened body\" when you fully recognize that your body is like a reflection in the mirror. At that time, the body becomes an enlightened body. An enlightened body does not mean that something nice or some extra element is added to your body or that, as with alchemy, you consume a magic drink and become something. It is not like that. Actually,&nbsp;this body&nbsp;is an enlightened body. What is an enlightened body? It is what we call&nbsp;nang tong sung jug, meaning it appears as a body yet is empty.\nAnd that manifests each cell and everything else in this body. But we are not experiencing that. What we experience now is that it is solid and real. We are getting old and have pain, and it is easy to get cold, easy to freeze, and easy to burn under the sun. Even though we try our best to have a lot of nice food, it is a big problem, isn't it? That is when we are in what we call \"samsara,\" or \"illusion.\" When we really recognize the nature of the body, our body is everywhere, and nowhere also.\nLet's practice this together. Please keep your spine loosely straight, and first feel your body. You can close your eyes with this practice and relax the muscles in your body.\nIf you cannot relax the muscles in your body, it is totally okay. No problem.\nNow, be aware of your body from head to feet. This is more like a general observation of your body, or being with your body on a general level, meaning your whole body. Be with the sense of wholeness of your body. And your body has feelings — maybe pain, pleasure, or neutral feelings. Then there are emotions, thoughts. All of this is going on in your body. Be with that.\nNow, you can particularly focus on one part of your body: your head, heart, arms, legs, or whatever else. For example, your head has so many different pieces, and all of these are changing and moving, they are interdependent and are vibrating, like the waves of the ocean.\nNow you can slowly, slowly focus on the deeper, more subtle level of your body. There are particles and atoms. The atom depends on subatomic particles. Then there are other subatomic particles. You can focus on more and more subtle levels, and in the end, it all loses meaning. Your body is baseless — beyond time, beyond matter. Yet you can have a body. Your body manifests like your own reflection in a mirror. Not just your body, but even feelings are emptiness. The sensations in your body are emptiness. Whether they are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral does not matter. When we recognize the nature of feelings as emptiness, sometimes we say that the feeling becomes the \"wisdom of the union of bliss and emptiness.\" And your body becomes the \"union of appearance and emptiness,\" or \"wisdom body.\"\nYou have feelings, you have sensations, you have a mind that is clear and knowing. You can hear, and even sound is emptiness. Empty sound is wonderful! It vividly manifests. Empty pain, empty bliss, empty confusion in the mind, thoughts, and emotions. They are empty, yet they vividly manifest. How wonderful! How amazing! Not only is your body the union of emptiness and appearance, but actually all phenomena are like that.\nIf you closed your eyes, now open your eyes. Whatever you see is the union of emptiness and appearance, just like sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, heaviness, lightness, heat, cold, everything.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, just rest. Rest your mind as it is.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n150 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;5 days&nbsp;of practice\nIn this practice, you will be guided through three steps for exploring physical sensations. They include the sense of solidity, the sense of fluidity and dynamism, and the sense of openness.\nBegin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture. Leave your eyes open for this analytical meditation.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything right now. Simply be natural.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for being here, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice if there is any sense of solidity in your body. For example, you might have a sense or feeling that you have a body.&nbsp;\nNow, take a deeper look and notice any inner experiences. Perhaps they are fluidly changing or shifting. Simply be aware of sensations as they are, in the present moment.&nbsp;\nNext, shift your awareness to unpleasant sensations, and notice if there is any sense of solidity in them. Pause and notice if the sensations are changing or if you can see the elements they are composed of.&nbsp;\nNext, reflect on what is beneath your physical sensations. Notice if there is a feeling of openness or space within and around them. Zero in on one area of your body and see if you can find and examine sensations there. Look deeper and deeper until you almost cannot find anything. There is just a feeling of openness.&nbsp;\nContinue to scan your body. Simply notice a sense of openness or space whenever it is present. This openness is what physical sensations arise from and dissolve back into. Are there physical sensations that you can find and pinpoint? If not, rest in this non-finding or ungraspability.&nbsp; End session Let go of the analytical meditation, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone.

It's an experience, which, once tested, can change your life, opening new dimensions and possibilities.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nhow emptiness manifests as appearances\nthe empty essence of all phenomena\nhow to examine the true nature of phenomena\ncommon experiennces when first learning about emptiness\nWatch Read\nNow we will have a journey to the luminous self.\nEmptiness has two aspects. Emptiness is beyond concepts, beyond subject and object,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;is not nothing. There is what we call \"clarity,\" \"luminosity,\" \"possibility,\" \"appearance,\" or \"perception.\" There is appearance — various phenomena appear — yet the essence of phenomena is empty.\nAlthough the essence of phenomena is empty, that emptiness manifests as phenomena. This is what we sometimes call the \"display of emptiness,\" or \"radiation of emptiness.\" For example, the sun has sunlight — the sunlight comes from the sun. The ocean has waves — the waves come from the ocean. The sky has clouds — the clouds come from the sky. Similarly, emptiness actually manifests as phenomena, clarity, or possibilities. So without the sky, there would be no clouds. Without the ocean, there would be no waves. Without the sun, there would be no sunlight.\nThis is really important to understand. In the beginning, it is not easy to comprehend. It cannot enter our mind because we are so used to our boxes of \"yes\" or \"no.\" We cannot go beyond these two, right? Therefore, this is a habit of ours.\nActually, our true nature is beyond this. In the last course, I mentioned going beyond time and matter. Take the \"attosecond,\" for example. The difference between a second and an attosecond is proportional to the difference between a second and thirty-one billion years, or something like that. That is what the scientists say, and we have similar examples. But then if you go deeper and deeper into that tiny second, in the end, it loses meaning. There is no time. But \"no time\" does not mean nothing. It is everything!\nWhen I say \"no time,\" I also mean \"no particle\" — we look at the tiniest part of both matter and time. And when we look at the particle, the particle almost loses meaning. The atom is 99% empty, and the remaining 1% is 99% empty, and, after looking at smaller and smaller parts, it almost loses meaning. The difference between that tiniest thing and the atom is like the difference between the solar system and the atom. Then, in the end, that thing also loses meaning. Time loses meaning, matter loses meaning. But the \"losing meaning\" is not nothing. That is everything. Everything is nothing. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Nothing is everything.\nI also gave an example, right? In a dream, there is no pizza, but you can enjoy the pizza. The dream pizza does not have even one single attosecond, or as we call it in our terms, \"indivisible time,\" you cannot really divide it. It does not have that. Yet, you can enjoy pizza. And when you enjoy pizza, if you know you are in the dream and you can enjoy pizza, actually, you can enjoy pizza without grasping. If another dream person tells you, \"You are stupid,\" you will not explode. Normally, our sense of self is like a volcano eruption ready to explode — easy to burn, easy to freeze, easy to cry. But in a dream, if you recognize the dream, and someone says bad words to you, you hear them, but it is okay. But you can see, you can hear — everything is there.\nWe have difficulty understanding that \"form is not different from emptiness and emptiness is not different from form.\" Why? It is very difficult to understand because we have concepts that are very tight.\nI will tell you a story. One time, a student came to Sherab Ling, where I studied and did a three-year retreat. My guru, Vajradhara Tai Situ Rinpoche, was teaching about emptiness meditation. And one student said, \"The problem is that everything is 'me, me me,' and that 'me' is very sensitive. From now on, I will make a new vow\" — a commitment — \"to not say 'me.'\" And Tai Situ Rinpoche said, \"It will not work. You just need to see the true nature of yourself. It is not by&nbsp;forcing&nbsp;that you get rid of grasping. It does not work.\" But the student did not listen. And sometimes we were communicating because we wanted to go to a market in town. This student would say, \"Tomorrow, maybe you and — [Mingyur Rinpoche points to himself] can go to town?\" He would not say \"me.\" There is a place called Dharamsala, and the student would say, \"Do you have time to go to Dharamsala tomorrow, you and — ?\" [Mingyur Rinpoche points to himself.] He did that for a few years, but later he became a little bit emotionally unbalanced, a little bit crazy. So, that does not work.\nWe really need to see our true nature, who we are, as it is, not by force. Sometimes, we have a habit of \"Empty, empty, empty. Everything is empty and does not exist.\" We just force ourselves to think about emptiness. Or, normally, when we do not know emptiness, we see everything as real and solid. \"I need that item. What about me?\" We fall into these two extremes.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that emptiness is beyond both subject and object. Another way of saying this is that it is beyond concepts. However, emptiness does not mean nothingness. If you were to share your understanding of the two aspects of emptiness with a friend, how would you explain them? Question 2\nIn illustrating the display of emptiness, Mingyur Rinpoche shares three metaphors, including the sun and its light, the ocean and waves, and the sky and clouds. What is the meaning of these metaphors? Points to remember:\nThe essence of phenomena is empty, yet they manifest.\nThe manifestation of emptiness is called \"clarity,\" \"luminosity,\" \"appearance,\" \"display,\" or \"possibility.\"\nGrasping at concepts leads to self-created suffering.\nThe true nature of self and phenomena is beyond duality.\nTip\nRespect both relative and absolute reality.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nthe main causes of self-created suffering\nhow relative reality is like a dream&nbsp;\nhow to perceive objects as being like reflections\na story illustrating how emptiness is not nothingness Joyful Wisdom, pp. 178–181 (Ch. 8, \"The Empty Other\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.1 Welcome to the Luminous Self Meditation\" data-href=\"3.5.1 Welcome to the Luminous Self Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.1-welcome-to-the-luminous-self-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.1 Welcome To The Luminous Self, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.1 welcome to the luminous self, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.1 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Appearance and Emptiness: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Appearance_and_Emptiness_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.1-welcome-to-the-luminous-self-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.1-welcome-to-the-luminous-self-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476409,"modifiedTime":1759272588064,"sourceSize":7292,"sourcePath":"1.

This creative aspect is the natural consequence of the union of emptiness and clarity.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nHere, what we need to do is explore emptiness in all phenomena, through sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. We have a very famous sutra called the \"Heart Sutra.\" In the Heart Sutra, it says, \"form is emptiness, sound is emptiness, smell is emptiness, taste is emptiness, and sensation is emptiness.\" All phenomena are emptiness. Basically, you can discover emptiness just by looking.\nYou can try to look at a table, and when you look at one leg, you cannot see the other leg clearly. But when you look at the other leg, you can hold that first leg on the conceptual level.\nBut the problem is that we do not know it is at the conceptual level for us. We grasp, and it becomes solid. We have biases. It becomes a source of a lot of negative emotion — a source of aversion, attachment, and ignorance, right? Here, it is really free! Sometimes we say, \"Enjoy the dance of phenomena. Enjoy the drama of phenomena.\" When we look at it that way, at a deeper level, it is very free, carefree. The really strong expectations, fear, and anxiety are based on the grasping of existence. We do not know that their nature is emptiness, so we are fixed and trapped with that. How to liberate that? You can look at phenomena through emptiness. Emptiness manifests with all phenomena, so just by looking you can see emptiness.\nThis is the case with sound, also. Take my name: Ming-yur Rin-po-che. When you hear \"Min,\" you do not hear \"gyur.\" When you hear \"gyur,\" \"Min\" is gone. Actually, what you really hear is \"gyur,\" so you do not hear my name. But on a conceptual level, it is okay. You can hear, very clearly.\nBut even \"Min\" has different sounds. Mi-in. Finished, right? It has a beginning and an end. [Mingyur Rinpoche snaps his fingers.] Each piece is there. Each piece is in a second, or a nanosecond. Actually, there is no sound,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;you can have sound — empty sound. And that empty sound, as it does not have inherent existence, could be anything.\nRemember about my corn? Because tall and short do not exist by themselves, they can manifest as anything. And it is the same with smell, taste, and touch. Explore the realm of emptiness in everyday life. When we do that, eventually samsara becomes nirvana, problems become solutions, and suffering becomes happiness.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a moment to reflect on a time and place during your upcoming day in which you can explore the emptiness of phenomena. Set an intention to recognize the play of phenomena by simply looking and remembering its union with emptiness. For example, when you take in beautiful scenery, remember that what you see is like the moon's reflection on a lake. Phenomena do not have any inherent existence, yet they appear. You can apply this practice to any aspect of your sensory experiences, including form, sound, smell, taste, and sensation. See what you notice in your experience when you reflect in this way. Rather than trying to look for the right answer or have the right experience, the practice is to let go of all your expectations and simply pause and look.Journal Reflection QuestionsWhat is it like to see the union of phenomena and emptiness in daily life, for example with sounds, visual objects, smells, tastes, or sensations?

In this section, as the section title suggests, we will focus on the so-called luminous self. Previously, in the first courses of this level, we have primarily focused on the unhealthy and healthy sense of self, what they mean, and how we can work on developing the latter of those two. Here, however, we will dive into the third sense of self — namely the luminous self.\nMingyur Rinpoche, as always, will give really profound teachings on this topic, helping us understand what this actually means, what the characteristics of the luminous aspect of emptiness are. From there, Rinpoche will guide us in how we can work with this in our meditation practice and also how to apply it in our daily lives.\nI do not feel that I have much, or anything, to add here. But what I perhaps can do is just to talk a little bit from my own experience studying and practicing with these teachings. One thing that has been very helpful in my own study and practice, as Mingyur Rinpoche has mentioned before, is this notion that because of emptiness, everything is possible and everything can take place. In other words, if it were not for emptiness, if things actually truly existed, nothing could happen.\nTo me, first hearing this statement, and then also studying it to increase my own understanding, has been really helpful to remove this notion, which is perhaps the biggest misunderstanding when it comes to emptiness, that emptiness means nothingness. What this statement points toward really fascinates me. Just this magical display that constantly takes place in our own experience — it is so seemingly solid and real but when looked at a little bit closer, or examined, nothing can be found, but it is still appearing right there in front of my eyes.\nTo me, recognizing this has been one of the most freeing experiences I have had. Of course, I am not saying here that I am always relating to what I am seeing, hearing, and experiencing as a magical display or a dream. On the contrary, the majority of my time I may not recognize this and be caught up in everything that happens around me, but the moments that I do have a short glimpse of this, it just creates this sense of, \"Oh, yeah, of course . . .\" and whatever I have been caught up in or worried about becomes a little bit more spacious. This does not mean that my feelings of worry, stress, or whatever it may be go away, but they are just held in a different light.\nI hope that you will find the teachings and practices within this section helpful in your own practice, and I am really looking forward to hearing from you in the forums. See you soon. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.2 the Luminous Self View\" data-href=\"3.5.2 the Luminous Self View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.2 The Luminous Self, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.2 the luminous self, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing The Luminous Self (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_The_Luminous_Self_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476391,"modifiedTime":1759272588082,"sourceSize":3303,"sourcePath":"1.

There are two luminosities. It looks like there are two, but they are the same. There is no difference.\nNow, we have a sense of self. And this sense of self is empty, isn't it? Yet, we can have this sense of self, and that idea enters our mind. Both the mind and the body are empty, yet they are not nothing. You can see, hear, smell, and taste. Everything is there. So, self- luminosity, self-appearance are one and the same.\nWe are going to experience this. First, keep your meditation posture, and rest your mind in open awareness. Just let it be.\nNow, feel the self, be with the self. Of course, now you know that the self is empty, yet you can have a self, you can have a body, and you can have a mind, which is knowing. You can see, you can hear. Through emptiness, you can see. With the emptiness of self, you can hear. With the emptiness of self, you can smell, taste, and touch. And you can feel whatever sensation there is now in your body — coolness, warmness, heaviness, or pain. Pain is the union of emptiness and pain.\nNow, we will do a special exercise, which is that emptiness is manifesting through all phenomena. \"Illuminating others\" means that through the eyes you can see objects, right? Now, please look at my face. Can you see my face? Normally, you would say, \"Of course,\" right? Where are you looking when you look at my face? Maybe you are looking around my eyes.\nActually, you do not see my entire face clearly. Although you do not see my entire face clearly, it is okay. Actually, you do not see my face, but it is okay. You can see, and at the same time, it is clear. You feel that you are seeing it clearly. And you will tell other people, \"Yes, I saw Mingyur Rinpoche's face. It looks like this.\" But actually, you did not see it.\nDo not move your eyes, and just look at my eyes. Do not move your eyes. When you are looking at my eyes, can you see my chin clearly, or my ears clearly? You cannot. Right? You do not see my entire face now. How about my eyes? Now, look at my eyes, and maybe you are looking right and left — you are moving your eyes. Do not move them. Stay with the right or the left eye — let's say the right eye. Can you see my left eye clearly? You cannot. But what we do is a quick scan, and then, \"Ah, I can see it.\" It is at the conceptual level. That is totally okay. Concepts do not exist, but they can exist on the conceptual level. Right? Knowing concepts as concepts is totally fine.\nNow, look at my right eye. Can you really see my right eye? Where are you looking? At the middle, or at the black or white part? At the skin? When you look at one, you cannot see the other clearly. Even when you look at one eye, there is skin, inside, outside, right, and left. When you look at one part, you cannot see the other parts clearly.\nAnd maybe if you could see a particle, there are still subatomic particles. Actually, when you look at it more and more deeply, you do not see me. You do not see my face. Actually, you do not see anything. Yet, it is because you do not see anything that you can see. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nSo, view everything just like the moon's reflection in a lake, or like a rainbow in the sky. When you listen to a sound, actually you do not hear the sound — but you can hear. You can both hear and not hear at once. And that is the real sound. At that point, you can really hear the nature of sound — the union of sound and emptiness.\nAnd with smell — actually, you do not smell anything. Because you do not smell, you can smell. There is the union of smell and emptiness; the union of taste and emptiness; the union of tactile sensation and emptiness.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind as it is, in emptiness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n180 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;6 days&nbsp;of practice\nIn this practice, you will explore how phenomena manifest in union with emptiness\nBegin session Begin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to be at ease and relaxed.\nTake a moment to touch into what your motivation is for doing this practice, as a way of gauging your heart and giving context to the practice. Just through deep caring, the practice can be of benefit to you and the world. Recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, take a moment to arrive in present-moment awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest in this natural, knowing quality of your mind. Main practice First, take a few moments to notice what is appearing in your mind. As sounds, sights, or thoughts appear, simply look and appreciate them. As you are aware of them, recognize that they do not inherently exist, yet they manifest. Notice that appearances are the play of the mind. Each appearance bubbles up within awareness.\nEach time your experience seems to solidify, look at its multiple components. Notice the empty nature of these components as they appear.\nNext, look at the knowing quality of the mind, which is self-luminosity. Ask yourself, \"Is there a \"knower\" to be found? If not, how can there be \"knowing\"?\" See what comes up when you reflect in this way.&nbsp;\nEach time you experience sleepiness, dullness, or agitation, reflect on the fact that this experience, too, manifests yet is empty.\nAll of this display is empty in essence, yet it manifests. Simply let all of these appearances bubble up like waves in the ocean. At times, the solid sense of self arises, and you might lose the recognition of emptiness. Appreciate this display, and recognize that it too is emptiness. End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. What stood out the most for you with this practice of seeing the union of sensory experiences and emptiness?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.2 the Luminous Self Application\" data-href=\"3.5.2 the Luminous Self Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.2 The Luminous Self, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.2 the luminous self, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.2 Meditation","face meditation","can you see my face"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Luminous Self: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_Luminous_Self_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476376,"modifiedTime":1759272588089,"sourceSize":7339,"sourcePath":"1.

Our previous practice was on the emptiness of our body. Our body is based on matter — particles and subatomic particles. We cannot really grab one single particle because it is interdependent, and there are many pieces — it is just an idea, and then it goes beyond. Because of emptiness, it manifests as this body.\nNow, we will look at the mind. What is the mind? \"Mind\" means \"knowing\" or \"consciousness.\" In general, we say the definition of the \"mind\" is \"clear and knowing.\" \"Clear\" means that the mind always cognizes itself.\nTake the example of a lamp. I think I gave you this lamp example in level one. A lamp has two particular qualities. One is what we call \"self-luminosity.\" The lamp is the light. I am talking about a flame here. In order to look at a flame, you do not need to use a flashlight because the flame is illuminated by itself. At the same time, it can illuminate things around itself, so that you can see things around you. If there is a watch, then the flame helps us to see the watch. The watch becomes visible. That is what we call \"illuminating others.\" The lamp has the quality of self-luminosity and that of illuminating others.\nIt is the same with our minds. As for the definition of mind, \"clear\" means that it illuminates itself. It is always clear, even if we are experiencing confusion, dullness, or even ignorance. These are experiences in the mind. Without the mind, you would not feel dullness, ignorance, or confusion. So the mind has clarity. And \"knowing\" means that the mind takes phenomena as its object — what you see, hear, smell, taste, and sense. Normally, we do not recognize the real natural quality of our mind: it is empty, yet through that empty aspect there is self-luminosity and the quality of illuminating others. Those are the two qualities of the mind. When we do not recognize that, then the self-luminosity appears as a self. We have this luminosity within us, in our mind, and we grasp at it as a self. Then the mind is also illuminating \"others,\" meaning that you can see and hear, and that becomes \"other.\" Actually, both are in your mind. This is like waves and the ocean — the waves are in the ocean. Or it is like the sky and the clouds — the clouds are always in the sky. And it is the same with the sun and light — the light comes from the sun.\nSo, these two aspects, self-luminosity and illuminating others, are the basis of whatever we see, whatever we experience, and whatever we are going through. There are forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations. All of these are manifesting from there. Here, we recognize self-luminosity as being empty, yet we can still have luminosity. And \"other-luminosity,\" illuminating others, is also empty, yet it can manifest. This is our main practice here.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the mind has two qualities: self-luminosity and \"other-luminosity.\" To illustrate these qualities, he uses the example of a lamp, which is able to illuminate itself, as well as that which is around it. How would you define luminosity (or clarity) in your own words? Question 2\nWhen we do not recognize the nature of mind as being empty, self-luminosity is mistakenly perceived as self, and \"other-luminosity\" is perceived as everything else. How does this connect to the topic of the unhealthy, healthy, and luminous sense of self? Points to remember:\nMind = clear and knowing\nWithout the clarity of mind, nothing could be experienced.\nMind has two qualities: self-luminosity and other-luminosity.\nInquiry\nWhich of your experiences are manifestations of the mind?\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nthe definition of luminosity, or clarity\nhow to practice what Mingyur Rinpoche calls \"nonmeditation\" or \"organic meditation\"\nabout the essence of meditation\nwhat happens when the luminous aspect of mind is recognized The Joy of Living, pp. 94–100 (Ch. 6, \"The Gift of Clarity\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.2 the Luminous Self Meditation\" data-href=\"3.5.2 the Luminous Self Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.2 The Luminous Self, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.2 the luminous self, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>The Luminous Self: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*The_Luminous_Self_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(10_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.2-the-luminous-self-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476371,"modifiedTime":1759272588103,"sourceSize":5013,"sourcePath":"1.

The more dukkha dissolves, the more our true nature emerges — our fundamental nature of being, which is not more present or absent, or bigger or smaller, depending on our moods and emotions.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nFor the application, whichever of the five&nbsp;kleshas&nbsp;you encounter in daily life: hatred, or anger, pride, desire, jealousy, or ignorance, look at the nature of it.\nOr sometimes look at the angry-er, the one who has the emotion. Sometimes, look at the object. All of these are emptiness.\nAnd then, especially here, is what we call the \"union of compassion and emptiness,\" or \"union of compassion and wisdom.\" This is really important because, normally, in level two, we develop love, compassion, joy, equanimity — all of these. But at that time, it is more at the relative level.\nNow, if you want to transform loving-kindness and compassion into wisdom, or for it to become ultimate practice — what we call \"nonconceptual loving-kindness and compassion\" — then you have to meditate with emptiness. This is really good for developing boundless love and compassion. Normally, when we develop love and compassion, then we have suffering — others' pain comes to us — because of concept. Love and compassion need wisdom. Without wisdom, love and compassion cannot become boundless — they remain limited.\nSo when you go out, look at everybody and see how everybody is emptiness. You are emptiness; all beings are emptiness. And they have emotions, just like you. The five kleshas. When they have these strong emotions, they are not happy. They are suffering. So think, \"Oh, actually suffering is not real; emotions are not real; samsara is not real.\" And all beings, by not recognizing emptiness, create samsara, meaning the \"circle of suffering,\" or \"loop of suffering.\" It is like a dog chasing its tail. Actually, it is not real. \"Oh, dear. By nature they are free. Their nature is wonderful. Their nature is peaceful. It is beyond suffering, beyond subject and object, beyond concept. But, they do not recognize it. They perceive dream-like suffering as real suffering. And they wander in samsara again and again. Oh.\"\nWhen you do this, then love and compassion eventually become very strong. And that love and compassion become one with the practice of emptiness. It becomes the union of wisdom and love and compassion, or emptiness in union with love and compassion. Try this in your life. This is really important.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the beginning of the day, decide on an emotion to use, and set an intention to recognize the empty nature of this emotion, the emotioner, and the object of the emotion. The emotion could be a minor irritation, like impatience, or one of the five negative emotions directed toward yourself. Alternatively, it could be an emotion directed toward someone you know, a celebrity, or the environment. Try looking at the emotion, the emotioner, and the object of the emotion through the lens of emptiness.Journal Reflection Questions\nAs you explore the principle of emptiness with others in daily life, does a sense of compassion ever arise? If so, is your experience of this compassion any different from your experience of compassion in the Joy of Living level 2 practices? Please explain.\nThis practice is not intended to minimize your emotional experience, but rather to help you transform your relationship to it. Does any transformation occur in your lived experience?

Welcome to this section. This section is on the emptiness of emotions. This, to me, is one that is very powerful, when we think of how much we have suffered through our emotions in life — not everybody but many of us — and how we just get entangled in different ways, and then are able to see these emotions from the perspective of wisdom, to see the energy of wisdom within them — this union of emptiness and clarity. It is really quite life-changing to do this, to see this, to know this. Earlier in my life, I would never have imagined this was possible. Emotions were something that I suffered a lot with. And then we discover that they can be there in their full manifestation, and yet in a moment of self-righteous anger — which can be pretty seductive, I have to say — we can allow that emotion to be present and not be in the heat of it, not be the one who is self-righteous and angry, and be able to see, to know, the wisdom that is within it. This is a path of discovery.\nI just hope that, as you go through this section, it will help you to find a way to not fear your emotions — I know for myself that fear of strong emotions was very strong — and that you are able to allow them without that feeling that you have to keep the lid on them, which does not mean we indulge them, but just let them be there and not be separated from wisdom — to know the nature, to really be present with wisdom.\nSo, see you in the forums. And I am looking forward to learning from you what you discover, what you find out. Thank you. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.3 Emptiness of Emotions View\" data-href=\"3.5.3 Emptiness of Emotions View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.3-emptiness-of-emotions-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.3 Emptiness Of Emotions, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.3 emptiness of emotions, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Emptiness of Emotions (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Emptiness_of_Emotions_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.3-emptiness-of-emotions-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.3-emptiness-of-emotions-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476356,"modifiedTime":1759272588125,"sourceSize":2211,"sourcePath":"1.

Traditionally, what we first practice is hatred or anger, then pride, then grasping or attachment, then jealousy, and the last one is ignorance. We practice that way, so anger is first. It is really vivid, and normally anger, hatred, or aversion makes us unhappy. Grasping can be attachment with the feeling of happiness. That is possible. \"Wow! Nice!\" You have attachment, and you are happy. But when you have aversion, there is a lot of fear or anxiety. It is not pleasant, not nice, and not good. So, we begin with aversion, anger, or hatred. They are all the same thing. If you have those with you now, wonderful! [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.]\nYou know that in level 1, I talk about the meditators who meditate in the mountains. Sometimes, some mountains are very nice, and we have five-star caves, you know? It is perfect. There are not so many problems up there. So some meditators go down into the village or town, or even the city and look for problems. And \"problem\" means an environment where a lot of kleshas, strong emotions, or problems may occur. Suffering — whatever problems and kleshas — helps us to transform everything into wisdom, and also love, compassion, and awareness.\nOkay, now we will practice together. Please keep your spine loosely straight. First, rest your mind in open awareness. As I mentioned before, sometimes when we practice open awareness, it automatically becomes emptiness meditation. Wonderful! Or sometimes we cannot differentiate between open awareness meditation and emptiness meditation. That is totally fine. That is good. Or they feel different. That is also okay.\nOkay. Now please try to create or remember an emotion. In level 1, I recommend that you do not make or create emotions. But here, you can create emotions first. Or if you do not have any emotions now, you can remember past emotions. If you already have strong emotions, great!\nFirst, what we do is practice with hatred or anger. Please try to develop hatred. Or remember an event that was not nice or bad things that happened in the past that you did not like.\nNow emotion will come. Let the emotion become mature.\nOkay. Now, please look at the essence of that emotion. That emotion is emptiness. The nature of that emotion is beyond time and beyond matter. And the emotioner, you, you are emptiness, just like a dream. And you have an object for the hatred. The object of that hatred is different than you, and that is also emptiness. Whether it is a person, animal, environment, or situation does not matter. The object is emptiness. It is like a dream again. It is as if one dream person is angry with another dream person.\nOr, when you look at its nature you cannot find the anger, or self, or the object. That is more like horizontal liberation. Or you can have anger, but anger does not inherently exist. It becomes like a feeling — a dream-like feeling. That is vertical liberation.\nIf the anger is still there, energy, clarity, and wakefulness are also there. But the wrong perception makes it appear as existent, tight, and narrow, and it seems easy to cry, easy to burn, easy to disappear. This is gone now. The essence of hatred is empty, yet it manifests.\nNow, hatred or anger transform into what we call \"mirror-like wisdom.\" Please rest your mind in the mirror-like wisdom.\nAnd you can do this with pride. Look at the nature of pride. The pride transforms into the wisdom of equanimity. You can practice with attachment, grasping, or desire. The nature of desire is emptiness. When you see that, desire transforms into the wisdom of discernment. Jealousy transforms into the wisdom of accomplishment.\nAnd the last one is ignorance. When you do not see the nature, that is nonconceptual. When you do not look at the nature, you do not see it. That is ignorance. When you look at the nature and do not see it,&nbsp;that&nbsp;is wisdom. And this nonconceptual wisdom is the basis for all wisdom.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest in wisdom. Whatever transformation you have, just be with that.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice\nIn this practice, you will examine an emotional experience in three steps and transform it into wisdom.&nbsp;\nBegin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture. Leave your eyes open for this analytical meditation.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything right now. Simply be natural.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice your current emotional state. Do you feel agitated, bored, interested, or uplifted? If no emotion is present, bring to mind a memory that brings up an emotional response. Remember, rather than starting with an overwhelming emotion, choose something manageable. Continue to notice any emotions that are present.\nNext, examine the subtle dimensions of the emotional experience. For instance, you might be aware of physical sensations in the body. The emotion might be experienced in the mind as thoughts, images, or words. Each emotion has its own flavor. It might arise as resistance or aversion towards something unpleasant, or as attachment or desire towards something pleasant. Explore the emotion beyond its label, and notice its richness and complexity.\nTake a short break from all the investigation, and rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nOnce again, begin with whatever emotion you have right now, or recall a memory that brings up an emotion. Be aware of the emotion and notice its subtle aspects.&nbsp;\nNow, check if you can locate the emotion. Is it in your body? Or in your mind? Let it be a playful exploration. See if you can pinpoint the emotion. If you cannot find it, simply let go and rest.&nbsp;\nAt times, emotions can be overwhelming. When you look more closely, you see that they are very complex. Now, see if you can explore even deeper to see the basic openness or inner space within which emotions arise.&nbsp;\nWhen you look for an emotion and cannot pinpoint it, you are experiencing that openness. Keep going with this a little longer. See if you can explore your inner world and find a boundary, an edge, or a center to your emotional experience. Is there a point at which the emotion begins and ends? The idea is not to find a perfect answer in this practice, but simply to look into the subtle nature of the emotion. End session Let go of the analytical meditation, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you examine the essence of an emotion, the emotioner, and the object of the emotion, are you able to relate to them as being dream-like? If so, what is your experience like?When you examine the essence of an emotion, the emotioner, and the object of the emotion, are you able to relate to them as being dream-like? If so, what is your experience like?When you examine the location of an emotion, as instructed in the guided meditation, do you find an exact location of the emotion?

Even intense or long-term emotional states are like bubbles.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe transformation of emotions into emptiness\nthe benefits of connecting to innate wisdom\nthe wisdom aspect of the five kleshas (negative emotions)\nWatch Read\nNow, we will discuss the transformation of emotions into emptiness, or into wisdom. This is a really important practice here. Before, we practiced how to work with emotions with the healthy sense of self. We looked at the emotion as pieces and looked at how they are related. For panic, there are sensations, images, voices, beliefs, and reasons. And when we take away one of those, there is no emotion, no panic. They are interdependent. And panic is changing and changing. It is impermanent. So we looked at it that way. When we did that, the power of this emotion — like hatred, panic, or depression — diminishes.\nNow, there is a difference. Here, we look at even the root of the emotion, which is self and other. There is duality, subject and object, and then the emotion itself. These three are all emptiness.\nWhen we practice emptiness with emotion, we say that \"emotion will transform into wisdom.\" It automatically transforms into wisdom. This is the key point. As I mentioned in level 1, there is self-transformation, self-antidote, and poison transforms into medicine.\nI mentioned a story with my teacher, Saljay Rinpoche, about water going in my ear. I could not get the water out of my ear, and my teacher said, \"Use water.\" So I put more water in, and I did this [Mingyur Rinpoche demonstrates tilting his head to get the water out of his ear], and that cleared the water out of my ear. So, water is used as an antidote to water.\nAnd then there is the story about a robber becoming your bodyguard. If your enemy becomes your friend, then there is no enemy. These are really important elements of self-transformation. Now, here, we use emotions — to be aware of the emotion, the emotioner, and the object of the emotion. These three are of course interdependent. They are changing at the relative level, but at the ultimate level they are emptiness.\nWhen we look at the nature of an emotion and we see that the emotion is emptiness, then the negative part of the emotion goes away. Why? Because what we call our \"true nature\" is wonderful. We all have a great enlightened nature. How to connect with our true nature? Through wisdom. Wisdom, awareness, and love and compassion. You do not have to make your true nature. You do not need to get rid of bad things. What do you have to do? Just connect. Wisdom, here, means to just explore the nature of yourself, the nature of emotion. Then the negative part will go away — \"negative\" meaning something which is not connected with your true nature. Something that is not innate will go away. Something that is not original or intrinsic, or that is born with you, will go away. This is really important.\nWe have one example. If there is a forest fire, that fire will burn the grass and the woods, but it cannot burn the rocks and stones. Likewise, wisdom, the wisdom of emptiness, burns the negative aspects of emotion. Emotion has a lot of positives also. These positive aspects will manifest without doing anything, but by just knowing the nature of the emotion. Nice, isn't it?\nTherefore, normally when we follow the unhealthy sense of self, although it looks like we have success, on a deeper level we feel hollow. But when we follow the healthy sense of self, we become successful and also happier. Now, the true nature — emptiness — is even more connected to who we are. Everything transforms into wisdom in the end. Everything transforms into happiness.\nHow will these&nbsp;kleshas&nbsp;or destructive emotions turn into wisdom? Normally, we say we have five kleshas. First is craving, grasping, or what we sometimes call \"attachment.\" A little attachment is okay. Attachment connected with the healthy sense of self is totally okay, like relative compassion involving a subject and object. Great! That is healthy.\nAt the relative level, these are okay. But too much becomes unhealthy. The grasping, or too much craving, becomes unhealthy. But here, we will go beyond both — all the grasping and attachment. Not by suppressing, not by ignoring, and not by controlling, but just by recognizing the nature of grasping. So there is grasping, and then we have hatred, anger, resistance, fear, and aversion. All these are similar and in the same category. Then we have ignorance, not knowing, confusion, and restlessness. All of these are similar. We could feel dull or unclear also. Then we have pride, thinking, \"I am the best.\" Then we have jealousy. We can look at the nature of these five kleshas, and then these five kleshas will transform into wisdom.\nTake grasping and attachment. When you look at the nature of attachment, when we see emptiness, then attachment transforms into the wisdom of discernment, meaning that attachment knows, \"I like this. This is for me. This is quality. There is benefit.\" There is a variety of things. There is a lot of positive things there, a lot of useful and beneficial things. This wisdom is very sharp.\nAnd then, when we look at the nature of hatred, anger, it will transform into the wisdom that we call \"mirror-like wisdom.\" When you have a lot of hatred and anger, you have a lot of energy. There is a lot of clarity. There is a lot of vibration. The positive part is there, like a mirror — very clear and transparent — and the negative aspects will go away.\nWhen we look at ignorance, it transforms into nonconceptual wisdom, or what we call&nbsp;dharmadhatu, meaning \"boundless space,\" or \"nonconceptual.\" Ignorance is similar to not knowing. There is no real judgment. There is a lot of openness there. Space. If you do not know about the detailed level, it looks like you are free.\nIf you do not know the nature of reality, it becomes ignorance. But if you know the nature of reality, then ignorance becomes nonconceptual wisdom. And pride becomes the wisdom of equanimity. Jealousy becomes the wisdom of accomplishment. Pride is to think, \"I am so good. They are not good.\" There is inequality. But then, when you look at the nature of pride, there is no inequality — everything is equal. So it becomes equanimity. And jealousy. You know, normally big companies will always have competitions, and they think competition helps achievement. And there&nbsp;is&nbsp;achievement there, but if you do not know the nature of that, that may become negative. It may become a cause of suffering. But when you see that the nature is emptiness, then jealousy transforms into wisdom of accomplishment.\nThis is how the five kleshas transform into wisdom, and we will practice this in the next session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the root of suffering arises from grasping onto the dualistic sense of self and other, subject and object. To illustrate how everything transforms into emptiness, he teaches that we can examine the emotion itself, the one who is feeling the emotion (emotioner), and the object of the emotion. If you were to share this key point with a friend, how would you explain this in your own words?\nPoints to remember:\nWhen examining an emotion, the \"emotioner,\" and the object of the emotion, the emotion is transformed within emptiness.\nWhen recognizing the nature of emotions, the five negative emotions transform into the five wisdoms:&nbsp; Anger → mirror-like wisdom\nAttachment → wisdom of discernment\nIgnorance → wisdom of dharmadhatu, all-encompassing space\nJealousy → all-accomplishing wisdom\nPride → wisdom of equanimity (equality) Tip\nDo not try to block or get rid of negative emotions. Instead, look directly into their nature.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout the illusory aspect of phenomena\nmetaphors for describing the mind\nabout relative and absolute reality\nhow the mind is the source of all experience The Joy of Living, pp. 100–103 (Ch. 6, \"Appearance and Illusion\"&nbsp;and&nbsp;\"The Union of Clarity and Emptiness\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.3 Emptiness of Emotions Meditation\" data-href=\"3.5.3 Emptiness of Emotions Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.3-emptiness-of-emotions-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">3.5.3 Meditation</a>","aliases":["3.5.3 Emptiness Of Emotions, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.3 emptiness of emotions, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Emptiness of Emotions: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Emptiness_of_Emotions_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.3-emptiness-of-emotions-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.3-emptiness-of-emotions-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476346,"modifiedTime":1759272588150,"sourceSize":9050,"sourcePath":"1.

You can bring this into your family life, you can bring this into your work life, or with friends in your leisure time. You can bring this everywhere. When we do that, a sense of love and compassion sometimes comes automatically. It is a sense of nonconceptual love and compassion. But, at the same time, all the suffering — although the panic might still be there, or depression or stress — is different than normal. This is what we sometimes call \"reflection-like suffering.\"\nThere is one famous example in Tibet. We have this grass called&nbsp;drema&nbsp;grass. We can dry that grass and make a rope out of it to tie things up. That rope can be burned in a fire, and after it is fully burned, it still looks like a rope. It remains the same shape and same color as a rope. When we compare one that is real with the one that is not real, they look the same. But actually, they are totally different. One is ash, actually, and cannot bind you. And the real one that is not burnt — that can bind you. This is one example.\nAnother example is when a volcanic eruption came thousands of years ago and all the forests became petrified wood. They look like trees but are actually stone. It will become like that. The panic, all this suffering, and everything become the union of emptiness and clarity eventually. But, of course, not right away. Okay? Do not expect that. There are many levels. I will tell you more about this later. We have what we call the \"understanding level,\" the \"experiential level,\" the \"direct realization level.\" Now, we are at the understanding level. Intellectually, we understand, and there is some glimpse of experience. But then, in everyday life, it is better that you stay with the healthy sense of self, the relative level. In everyday life, practicing emptiness does not always work. Sometimes when you think about emptiness, anger can become stronger. \"I am emptiness. Anger is emptiness. The object of anger is emptiness. But what is the point if the person really beats me?\" Or suffering. \"My knees are emptiness. The pain is emptiness,\" but your knees are really having a problem on the relative level. \"What is the point?\"\nExperientially, we cannot really see emptiness. Forget about what we call the \"perception level\"! We still see things as being solid. There is a step-by-step process, so do not worry about this right away.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesAt the start of each day, think of an upcoming, potentially challenging situation that you might encounter. Set the intention to work with this practice during this experience. Remember, use a manageable situation, rather than one of the most difficult ones. It could be itchiness or a minor pain in your body, uneasiness in a particular relationship, or some form of light distress. First, set the intention to recognize the empty nature of the challenging situation. Then, when you encounter the situation during the day, pause and be aware of the empty nature of the experience. For instance, you can try to experience it as if you were seeing a reflection in a mirror. If it is helpful, you can also examine the nature of the one who is experiencing, the object of the experience, and/or the empty nature of your particular reaction.Journal Reflection Questions\nWhen you set an intention to bring the practice of suffering and emptiness into daily life, does staying with the intention impact your experience in any way? If so, please explain.\nAs you meditate on suffering in daily life and reflect on its illusory nature, is there anything that shifts in your experience?\nFor many of us, meditating on the union of suffering and emptiness can be challenging. Do you experience it this way?

This is Lucas again. This is the fourth and final section of this course on the luminous self. In the previous section, Mingyur Rinpoche guided you through how to understand, practice, and work with the emptiness of emotions, and here, we will explore how we can do the same with regard to suffering.\nThere are so many gems included in this section, and Mingyur Rinpoche clarifies a lot of what might be difficult points for most of us when talking about emptiness and wisdom in this level.\nThere are a few things that stand out to me here in this section that I just want to touch upon. One of them is this notion of suffering being an internal, mental state, and once we recognize the emptiness of this suffering, the suffering actually goes away. There are, as Mingyur Rinpoche has taught previously in this Joy of Living series, two types of suffering: natural suffering and self-created suffering. Of course, when recognizing emptiness, the self-created suffering goes away, so far so good — perhaps. But the natural suffering actually goes away as well. Remember, we are not saying that the situation causing the natural suffering, like a forest fire, goes away, but the suffering we are experiencing internally because of this dissolves. This is interesting to me because I think many of us think of suffering as being an external condition rather than a mental state.\nThe second point here that I wanted to touch upon, that ties into the first one, is how to work with and relate to this in our daily lives. When we hear that the suffering goes away when we recognize emptiness, it may sound as if one becomes careless or does not recognize the suffering caused by different things in society and the world, and therefore becomes passive. This is not what is meant here, however. On the contrary, I believe that when our own suffering lessens through our practice and understanding and recognition of emptiness, and we are not so caught up in or overpowered by it, we may be able to look at a situation more clearly and thereby also make better or more helpful decisions. It does not mean that we are overlooking, for example, injustices, but rather that we can engage and connect with others even more and make healthier decisions when we are no longer experiencing that intense suffering ourselves.\nAlso, as Mingyur Rinpoche will talk about in the part on application, it is important here to balance our daily life application to perhaps be more on the level of the healthy sense of self, where we can relate to the relative level in a skillful way — where our view and application can meet. Always trying to apply emptiness practices in our daily life and interactions may not be such a good idea, especially in the beginning.\nSo, these were just a few thoughts, and I hope there will be much for you to reflect upon and practice within this section. Please share your thoughts, questions, and experiences with us, your fellow meditators, in the forum. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.4 Emptiness of Suffering View\" data-href=\"3.5.4 Emptiness of Suffering View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.4-emptiness-of-suffering-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.4 Emptiness Of Suffering, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.4 emptiness of suffering, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Emptiness of Suffering (5 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Emptiness_of_Suffering_(5_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.4-emptiness-of-suffering-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.4-emptiness-of-suffering-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476326,"modifiedTime":1759272588173,"sourceSize":3673,"sourcePath":"1.

It could be uneasiness. It could be dissatisfaction. It could be problems with your partner, your co-worker, your boss, or your staff, or environmental problems. I have mentioned before that for me it was panic. Or it could be depression. But if the panic, depression, or stress are so strong that you cannot meditate, then what we suggest, normally, is to see a therapist or take medication at the beginning. The medication will really help at a physical level, and then you will be able to meditate a little bit. Medication, meditation, and physical exercise — if you do those three together it really helps. Later, you can let go of the medication and then stay with the meditation. And some physical exercise will be good. This is how to transform.\nAlso, you can practice with any kind of physical sickness, like pain. If you have pain in your knees, you can meditate with the pain. The pain is in union with emptiness. But if it is too strong or painful, then, of course, you need to check this with the doctor. For the true relative level or for the healthy sense of self, we have to respect interdependence — causes and conditions — and impermanence, right? So try your best to work with the relative level.\nBut then, for the absolute level, you are carefree. Whatever problem you may have is wonderful. You do not need to look for problems. Free problems just come to you. You do not need to pay. You do not need to make a special schedule, like the meditators in the mountains, so it is wonderful! It is a great opportunity to transform.\nPlease keep your spine loosely straight, and rest your mind in open awareness meditation first.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, whatever problem or suffering is in your life, be aware of it. And fully be with the problem. \"Fully\" means to be with the problem and recognize it.\nNow, see that the nature of the problem is emptiness. Who is having this problem? That is also emptiness. And the causes or the object of the problem are also emptiness.\n[Silent meditation]\nWhile you are doing that, maybe when you look at it that way, in your mind there is a gap. That is the horizontal level of emptiness. That is great, be with the gap. You cannot find it — but you did not find it, so it is not nothing. There is an experience of emptiness there.\nOr you see the problem. The nature of the problem is emptiness, yet the problem is still there. That is vertical liberation.\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, rest your mind in the union of happiness and emptiness; the union of liberation and emptiness; the union of suffering and emptiness; the union of pain and emptiness; or the union of panic and emptiness.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice\nIn this practice, you will learn to see the nature of suffering. This practice can be challenging, so remember to engage in it for short moments, many times, especially in the beginning.&nbsp;\nBegin session Begin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to be at ease and relaxed.\nTake a moment to reflect on your motivation for doing this practice. If possible, give rise to the intention to know suffering directly and be free from confusion, in order to be of benefit to others. Recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. You do not need to do anything. Simply rest in this natural, knowing quality of your mind. Main practice First, take a few moments to notice if you feel any specific suffering in this moment. For instance, you might feel discomfort, uneasiness, or distress in your physical body, or unpleasant states of mind. The suffering could be based on memories of an event that happened in the past.&nbsp;\nNow, turn your attention to this experience, and see if you can notice the empty nature of it. For instance, you might see an emotion, some reactivity, or dissatisfaction as a rainbow-like appearance.\nNext, explore the object or the trigger for your suffering. Notice that this, too, is empty in essence; that it is a rainbow-like experience. There is nothing graspable, yet it appears.&nbsp;\nNow, look at the one who knows this experience. When you look, you cannot find anyone who knows. There is nothing substantial to be found, yet there is knowing.&nbsp;\nWe can allow the appearance of anger, sadness, or whatever we feel to be there fully, without fear, while seeing the emptiness of it. As you loosen your grasp on the suffering, the experience may simply vanish. That is the horizontal gap. Or, maybe your experience remains — the flavor or appearance is there — and yet there is no suffering. That is \"vertical liberation.\"&nbsp;\nIf the practice starts to feel overwhelming, shorten the session, or apply the four steps for meditating with emotions: (1) main practice, (2) try something different, (3) step back, and (4) take a break. At times, wisdom knows when to take a break. End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When examining the nature of suffering, the one who experiences suffering, and the object of suffering, does your experience change in any way as compared to when simply being aware of suffering? If so, please explain.Mingyur Rinpoche instructs you to rest your mind in the union of suffering and emptiness. Does this approach to practice shift your experience of suffering in any way? If so, what is your experience like?Inquiry\nAre you able to see other people through the lens of emptiness?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.5.4 Emptiness of Suffering Application\" data-href=\"3.5.4 Emptiness of Suffering Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.4-emptiness-of-suffering-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.5.4 Emptiness Of Suffering, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.5.4 emptiness of suffering, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.5.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Emptiness of Suffering: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Emptiness_of_Suffering_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.4-emptiness-of-suffering-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.5/3.5.4-emptiness-of-suffering-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476319,"modifiedTime":1759272588182,"sourceSize":6984,"sourcePath":"1.

Because here, when we recognize the nature of suffering as emptiness, then suffering will go away. Suffering is a mental state, of course. When the suffering goes away, what is there? There is wisdom; there is love; there is awareness. That is what we call the real \"nirvana,\" or \"liberation.\" That is real happiness, lasting happiness, unconditional happiness, or nonconceptual happiness. It is not like drinking coffee. Happiness from drinking coffee is conditional, right? Good for twenty minutes. Then, when there is happiness, unhappiness is also there. However,&nbsp;this&nbsp;happiness is beyond happiness and unhappiness, or beyond happiness and suffering. It is happiness, but happiness without grasping, without concepts.\nAt the beginning of the course, I mentioned the rubber snake, right? As long as you believe the rubber snake is a snake, then, no matter how you try to work with your fear and all of this, it helps only temporarily. In level one, we are aware of sensations, fear, or anxiety in the body. Or we listen to sounds or try something different. Or we step back or take a break. It helps, but temporarily.\nThen, in level two we practice with love and compassion, \"Oh, the snake wishes to be happy. It does not want to suffer.\" It helps more, but it is still temporary.\nBut when you see the rubber snake as a rubber snake, that is the real wisdom. Actually, all this suffering, all these problems, are emptiness — they are not real. Therefore, real happiness comes when we know everything is emptiness, from wisdom. If you recognize you are dreaming, then you can enjoy the dream pizza, and you can enjoy the dream environment, people, or whatever else — even if you have a tiger coming at you, or a robber, or war is coming to you. Whatever obstacle or problem you face in the dream, on a deeper level you will not have fear. You can enjoy it. You can see it like you are watching a movie. Why? Because you know the nature of reality. You know the dream as a dream. So, what we call the \"ultimate liberation\" or \"freedom\" comes by recognizing the wisdom of emptiness. Actually, suffering is not real, and being born, getting old, sickness, and death are also not real. Of course, sometimes this is hard to believe, right? But all of this is like a dream, actually.\nOf course, you will not experience that right now, that all this is like a dream. Maybe intellectually you understand it is emptiness, but feeling-wise you have to take care of your body. It is really important. Drink fresh juice, water — although it does not exist. Eat well, be aware of your diet, and do physical exercise. It is really important. Help others, be kind, be nice. It is really important. Follow right action — ethical conduct is very important. But, at the ultimate level, it is all emptiness.\nNow, I would like to talk about how we can transform all this suffering into happiness. Normally, suffering for me was when I was young and had panic attacks, so I did this practice with my panic. Of course, first I learned meditation according to level one meditation. I watched panic, then feelings. Sometimes I would listen to sounds, then go back to the breath. Then, I practiced love and compassion, the essence of panic. Underneath the panic, there is love and compassion. That helped. Then I practiced the healthy sense of self. Panic has pieces, and it is interdependent and changing. That helped. But what really helped me to break through my panic was emptiness meditation.\nSo I did all this — it helped. But then, one day in my retreat, the first year in my three-year retreat, the panic became very strong. Then I totally accepted it in the end, because panic is like a dream, I am like a dream, and everything else is like a dream. So then I just jumped into the panic. I really welcomed it. I did not try to change or fight it. And the panic was there, vividly present. But, at the experiential level, there was a sense of emptiness that is very difficult to put into words. You cannot really grab the nature of panic. The sensations, the feelings, the images — everything is like a mirage. It is like a moon in the lake. I could see the panic was empty, yet there was panic. It was almost like the panic and emptiness experiences became one. From there, the deeper level of fear of panic, aversion of panic, or the panic of panic, went away — although symptoms were still there, and they continued for a few days. That was really beneficial for me, and we can do that with panic. But, of course, I tried that starting from when I was nine years old, and it took me five years. Sometimes it takes some time, and I was lazy also. I was not so busy, but lazy.\nYou can do that with depression, also. Of course, at first, you have to practice with level one. There are four steps, right? The first is to be aware of it. The second is to try something different. The third is to step back, and the fourth is to take a break. Then you can see that the nature of depression is also love and compassion. But, actually, here it is emptiness, wisdom.\nThis practice really helps us to bring emptiness into experience, into life, into our bodies. Otherwise, we only understand emptiness at the intellectual level: \"Yes, it is emptiness, but what is the benefit in everyday life?\" Actually, the real transformation for us comes with the wisdom of emptiness. This helps with low self-esteem also, or family or relationship problems. When we have relationship problems, we have too much fixation and attachment. We grasp at things as existent. And that grasping at existence makes us really unhappy. It is easy to burn, cry, and disappear. But when you see it is emptiness, then on a deeper level, you have peace, contentment, and joy. All this will come. But then, there are still situations. Dream-like life is still there, and it is easy to manage, actually. You can see the bigger picture. Normally our mind is very narrow, and now it will open up.\nFor mental suffering or physical suffering, or stress, which is one of the major problems, this meditation will be very important in seeing the emptiness of stress. Stress in union with emptiness becomes freedom or liberation.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that liberation comes from recognizing everything as emptiness, including family and friends, physical problems, stress, and mental challenges. This can be challenging as we often identify with many of these things.

Now you are at the end, you have finished — nice, but it has ended! It is impermanent, right?\nUntil now, what you have learned is all of these three levels. All of these teachings have been, for me, very easy. It has the essence of many lineages or styles of meditation techniques combined together, and it is completely natural, it is the self-transformational, self-antidote, or self-liberation style. Now, it is really important to practice this in your life and with formal meditation, of course. You can do formal meditation every day, maybe for half an hour, fifteen minutes, one hour, or whatever time you can. Fully dedicate the time to that, every day. You need to build this habit. To build a habit takes about 30 days. Traditionally, we say it takes 21–30 days to build a new habit. Begin with that, and if you continue to do it for three months, it will become solid.&nbsp;\nThe second thing is informal meditation. You all know that you can meditate everywhere, anytime, with anything, under any circumstances, right? Now, you have plenty of techniques, plenty of tools with which to transform — what I call \"toolkits.\" In many places, mechanics who want to fix pipes or electrical circuits have big belts, and each section of the belt has different tools. And you have tools of awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom. You have these three big tools, and within those you have many \"sub-tools.\" Sometimes we forget all of these tools. Sometimes awareness is more effective in certain situations, in some environments. Sometimes love and compassion are more effective, more beneficial. Sometimes wisdom is more effective and beneficial.&nbsp;\nLook at your own personality and mood, and also the time of day, or different situations or environments. Follow your heart, follow your feeling, follow your mind, and adjust. And make it creative — that is really important. Practice and make it creative. \"For one week, I will focus on awareness to work with this particular object.\" Or maybe to develop awareness especially with creativity, with openness. You could work with anxiety one week and the next week maybe with hatred, or maybe with the environment. The next week you could work with love and compassion for all beings. The next week, \"Maybe I will work with wisdom.\" So something changes. We should follow impermanence. Change is good. We like creativity at a deeper level, so change is good. With these two together, we feel very happy.&nbsp;\nI learned these meditations when I was nine years old, and I still practice levels one, two, and three. All of these are essential practices of meditation. They are really important, fundamental practices of all of meditation. Even though you have finished this Training, you can always come back, like me — I am still practicing. So you can join again at level one, two, or three. Each time you join these levels, you will understand more. Even the same word, the same teaching, you will understand differently. \"Wow! That is what the real meaning is. Why did I not understand this before?\" Each time, there is an \"Aha!\" moment, a \"Wow!\" moment. You can take it as a life-long practice.\nHopefully, this course will benefit you, bringing you happiness, freedom, joy, and manifest your innate love, compassion, and wisdom for the benefit of yourself and others.&nbsp;\nThank you! Conclusion by Kunsang Palmo Read\nLooking back through the Joy of Living sequence — Calming the Mind, then Opening the Heart. and finally Awakening Wisdom — we have developed a more and more subtle and intimate relationship with our mind, a relationship that has given us the opportunity to explore how we can thrive in the midst of our daily lives.\nIt is almost as if we have come full circle to a place where we can resonate with the poignancy of the words Rinpoche shared with us at the very beginning of our journey: \"All the qualities of your natural mind — peace, openness, relaxation, and clarity — are present in your mind just as it is. You do not have to do anything different. You do not have to shift or change your awareness. All you have to do while observing your mind is to recognize the qualities it already has.\" In the process of deepening our recognition of awareness, we have discovered the innate qualities that abide in the nonjudgmental space of awareness. We have experienced that these qualities arise in relation to the world around us — in our relationships, our communities, our families, and our workplaces.\nAs our path continues to unfold, a part of our learning experience has to do with giving ourselves the time and space for reflection, continuing to acknowledge and explore our inner life through our ongoing commitment to sit, each day, and learning a day at a time to carry ourselves externally in a way that is attuned to where we want to be internally.\nFor myself, this feels like a path of tender generosity. We can see in the end, if we try to avoid unpleasant experiences, that more suffering will usually arise and that when we are able to hold everything a little more gently, when we find our own way out of suffering, we learn to trust ourselves.\nI am sure you feel a sense of satisfaction and appreciation for this extraordinary opportunity to come together in a safe space around a shared intention. And we can delight in having shown up as we are, in trusting in the practice, having the willingness to look and explore with courage. Each contributing to the collective wisdom that has emerged, we have discovered that our hearts are huge. Conclusion by Antonia Sumbundu Read\nHello, everyone. This is Antonia. Here we are at the end of not just this course but also the Joy of Living journey. I really want to take a moment to thank you. Thank you so much for your participation, and thank you so much for your practice. This is really something that we can rejoice in and something that we can appreciate — that we have made it.\nI know for many of you, it is something that has been over a number of months, or maybe even more than a year. And this is something that you really have invested a lot of time and energy in. And where that comes from is care — care for yourself, care for the ones around you, and care for understanding and really wanting to live a life where you are more awake and more fully present. Thank you so much for that.\nAs you are probably already aware, these practices and teachings are some that we can continue to work with and that we have not completed just because we have now completed the course. I really encourage you to go back and maybe do it all over again, or look at some of the pieces that really spoke to you and revisit those, and just see how the practice continues to unfold. But you can also look at any of the practices or teachings that you felt you really did not connect with so much this time, just to give it another try, give it some more time, or look at it when you are in another situation or another point of time in your life. And see how it may actually turn out that it, too, is like a treasure box, and that there are some treasures to be revealed for you.&nbsp;\nI also very much want to thank you for the sense of community that has arisen and grown as we have been going through these teachings and practices together. I really encourage you to continue to find ways of practicing with others and ways of really inspiring your practice and your life, and to continue to learn. As you know, the Tergar Meditation Community has a variety of offerings in this regard. Really feel free to continue working with some of these.&nbsp;\nSo, thank you so much. It has been a real joy, and I wish you all the best. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"What to Do Next\" data-href=\"What to Do Next\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/what-to-do-next/what-to-do-next.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">What to Do Next</a>","aliases":["3.6 Timeless Awareness, Conclusion - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6 timeless awareness, conclusion - Tergar joy of living course","3.6 Conclusion"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Conclusion to the Course (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Conclusion_to_the_Course_(15_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/what-to-do-next/what-to-do-next.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6-timeless-awareness-conclusion.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476669,"modifiedTime":1759272588213,"sourceSize":8783,"sourcePath":"1.

The issue is whether we recognize these aspects or not. Liberation arises only with recognition, not just from having these natural qualities.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nWelcome again. This is the last module, the last course. Until now, what we learned in levels 1, 2, and 3 are three things: awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom. In level 1, the main focus is awareness. In level 2, the main focus is love and compassion. Now, in level 3, the main focus is wisdom. Although there is a main focus for each of these, in the end, these three are one. Awareness&nbsp;is&nbsp;love and compassion. Love and compassion&nbsp;is&nbsp;wisdom. And wisdom&nbsp;is&nbsp;awareness. They all are inseparable in the end.\nWith this level 3 practice, first we look at the unhealthy sense of self. Being with the unhealthy sense of self is awareness, right? If you do not see it, it is nonconceptual. Great. If you see it, that is also good. You are not in it.&nbsp;\nDo you remember horizontal liberation and vertical liberation? That is awareness. Normally, we say that awareness is like the sky. Here, the unhealthy sense of self is the clouds.\nSecondly, we are not trying to get rid of the unhealthy sense of self. We are not trying to change the unhealthy sense of self. We allow it, accept it, and be with it. That is great love, forgiveness, and compassion. All these real practices are there.\nThen, wisdom means knowing the nature of reality as it is. Now we know. Even the unhealthy sense of self is just a feeling. It is just a concept that you feel, or you have an image of it. When you look into that more, there are pieces, and these pieces are connected with each other. They are interdependent and are constantly changing.&nbsp;\nWe also learned about the healthy sense of self, right? When we look at the unhealthy sense of self, what we discover is the healthy sense of self, eventually. Then we look into the healthy sense of self more, and what we see is emptiness in the end. It is beyond everything.\nWe focus on going beyond everything — the empty aspect. In one course, we were more focused on that. And in another course, we were more focused on the \"ness\", clarity, possibility, or appearance aspect. In this course, we will focus on the union aspect: the empty and clarity, or possibility aspects, are one.\nSometimes we say the particular focus of this teaching is buddha nature, timeless awareness, or our true nature.\nWelcome from Kunsang Palmo Read\nAs we come to this, the last section of the entire Joy of Living series, we can look back and appreciate how our understanding of the path has slowly evolved.\nWe might notice that a subtle but profound shift is taking place — a gradual transformation — from confusion to clarity.\nSeeing my experience change from rather anxiously chasing after a state of mind I wanted to obtain, to having glimmers of and touching into the fullness and well-being that is already present, already here, has been deeply satisfying.\nIn this section, Rinpoche will describe how it is through the recognition of our inner qualities that they become activated.\nThere is a kind of paradox in this process of recognizing and awakening to what is already here. As we learn to release more of our clinging, we discover more of the qualities already present.\nI hope you appreciate and take joy in this heart opening journey of discovery. The journey of making the invisible, visible. The journey of coming home.\nT. S. Eliot encapsulated this so beautifully in his famous words: \"We shall not cease from exploration\nand the end of all our exploring\nwill be to arrive where we started\nand know the place for the first time.\" Kunsang Palmo met Mingyur Rinpoche in 2006 and became his committed student in 2008. After immersing herself in the practice of meditation at Sherabling Monastery in 2014, she recognized the benefits and consequently responded to the requests of young international travelers by facilitating the Dharamsala Tergar group in North India.&nbsp;She now lives in North India where she continues her practice and hosts the Tergar group. She hopes that her dedicated approach to her life and work, inspired by Mingyur Rinpoche's teachings, brings some benefit to others.\nWelcome from Antonia Sumbundu Read\nHello, everyone! Welcome. This is Antonia. What a joy it is for me to be able to welcome you here to this course on timeless awareness.&nbsp;\nThis is the last course in the Joy of Living series, and I just want to invite you to take a moment to reflect back on how the journey has been for you so far. You may think about the time when enrolled in and started the Joy of Living course. What are some of the things you have seen? What are some of the things you have learned and experienced? What are some of the challenges you have encountered, and how have you worked with them? Just look at what you have learned about your own practice and what is supportive for your practice, and maybe what you have learned about the pacing that works for you.&nbsp;\nHere, when we are beginning this course, we could bring all that wisdom from our experience, from what we have learned from the journey so far — we can bring that to this beginning, so that it really can help us with the attitude that we enter this course with.\nIt may be different for all of us, knowing that this is the last course in this series. Some of us may be excited that we will have completed something. For some of us, there may be a little bit of a sense of worry. \"What will I do after this?\" For some of us, it may not be something that we have thought a lot about or are thinking a lot about. And all of that is really fine. But I really want to invite you to just pause and acknowledge that we are still on this journey, we are still in this practice, and we are still receiving new teachings and new instructions, so that we do not rush too much.&nbsp;\nThis course on timeless awareness is really like coming full circle. We are coming back to exploring awareness as we have done throughout the journey, throughout the different courses. But I am sure you will also experience how we start to see everything that we have been going through so far in a new light with the teachings that we will be receiving in this course.\nYou are very familiar with the format, of course. Again, I invite you to use the forum and to support each other in that way, to experience how helpful it can be when we articulate some of our own experience, how something becomes more clear to us, and also to know that it can be really helpful for others to learn from our experience.&nbsp;\nSo, I really wish you the best and look forward to connecting with you. Antonia Sumbundu has been a Buddhist practitioner for more than 30 years. In 2002, she met Mingyur Rinpoche and began to receive teachings from him.\nAntonia is a specialist in psychotherapy and supervision and has a M.Sc. in psychology from the University of Copenhagen and a M.St. in MBCT from the University of Oxford. Her work focused on the clinical applications of meditation before shifting to teaching meditation in a different setting. She has worked for Tergar International as an instructor since 2015.

It is very easy, actually. You do nothing, and you are perfectly fine.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nIn everyday life, the main practice is of course to see everything as a manifestation of love and compassion. Here, \"love and compassion\" refers to nonconceptual love and compassion. This love and compassion is beyond, yet everything takes place. There is a union between these two. Why are these two together? That which brings them together is innate love and compassion. This innate love and compassion is within you and all beings — but we need to recognize it. In order to recognize it, if we cannot recognize it in the beginning, we need to have a trigger — a trigger for love and compassion. Normally we will have something like my panic. Panic has a trigger. Here, you need a good trigger, which is that first you have to see emptiness — how everything is beyond suffering and bondage. It is free and peaceful. However, you may not recognize that. Sometimes you rest in emptiness and look at everybody and see that everybody is wonderful by nature. But maybe from their perspective, they do not know that they are wonderful. In level one, we talked about having ten qualities. If you have ten qualities — nine positive and one negative — you only see the negative one. Others might not see this. So there is a wanting to help them — wanting and wishing them be free and to be with their true nature. You can also recognize this love and compassion in your negative emotions. We have talked about the five&nbsp;kleshas. Their essence is also now this great love and compassion.\nWhy do these great kleshas arise? You do not want any problems. You want to be happy. You want everything to be nice. We looked into this — our wanting to be happy and not wanting to suffer — and we connected with this in level two. At the basic level, we do not have any problems. We do not have any suffering. Instead, we are free, peaceful, and calm, because it is beyond — everything is empty, yet it is not nothing. It can manifest as everything. The empty aspect&nbsp;is&nbsp;love. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;compassion. That empty aspect manifests as clarity, as phenomena — as everything. You can see this in the five kleshas, which then transform into wisdom and into nonconceptual love and compassion. We can see this in the nature of the five kleshas, which are the five wisdoms. These are the five wisdoms: Ignorance is&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;— the empty aspect is ignorance. Hatred is clarity — mirror-like wisdom. That is the clarity aspect. The wisdom of equanimity is the union aspect. Then, the wisdom of discernment is the manifestation. From this union, everything comes and manifests. Sun has sunlight. The ocean has waves. This is the fourth. The fifth is the wisdom of accomplishment, meaning that all these manifestations of love and compassion are achieved. \"Achieved\" means that when we recognize our true nature more and more, we automatically become free from suffering, problems, and obstacles. We automatically manifest our innate qualities — the kayas and the wisdoms. \"Kayas\" are the enlightened body. \"Wisdom\" is the enlightened mind. All of these manifest. That is the achievement — the wisdom of accomplishment. In our innate nature, there are these five wisdoms. Also in the outer world, all phenomena have the same manifestation — the radiation of the five wisdoms.\nWhen we do not recognize them, they become the five kleshas in the mind. Externally, they are the five elements — sky, earth, water, fire, and wind — and the five colors, the five realms or different realms, and the five&nbsp;skandhas. \"Skandhas\" refer to the body, the forms, feelings, concepts, mental factors, which are all the different thoughts and emotions, and then the consciousness, or the mind. They may become the five skhandas, the five directions, and so on. So many things manifest.\nSee the nature of all of these things as emptiness in union with compassion. From this aspect, the union means love and compassion.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nTake a moment to set the intention to recognize emptiness in daily life. For example, when you interact with a family member or friend, or see a stranger, try viewing them through the lens of emptiness.&nbsp;\nNext, reflect on your upcoming day, and decide on when and with whom you would like to apply the practice, whether with a loved one, a neutral person, or a difficult person. When you see this person, see if you can recognize the true nature of the person, and notice how the person's emotions or actions are the manifestation of the fundamental wish to be happy and free from suffering. After applying this practice, see if your relationship with them changes in any way.\nAt the beginning of the day, decide which of the five negative emotions, or&nbsp;kleshas&nbsp;— anger, attachment, ignorance, jealousy, or pride — you would like to focus on. First, set an intention to recognize the essence of this emotion. Then, when you experience the emotion, try recognizing this very essence. Remember, practice in short moments, repeated many times.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nAs you explore the principles of emptiness with yourself, a loved one, a neutral person, a difficult person, and eventually all beings, does anything shift in your relationship to them?\nAs you explore the principle of emptiness within negative emotions, does anything change in your lived experience of them?\nTip\nKnow that the limited views you hold of yourself and others are ultimately manifestations of your wish to be happy and free from suffering.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.1 Welcome to Timeless Awareness Summary\" data-href=\"3.6.1 Welcome to Timeless Awareness Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.1 Welcome To Timeless Awareness, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.1 welcome to timeless awareness, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.1 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Timeless Awareness: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Timeless_Awareness_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476656,"modifiedTime":1759272588236,"sourceSize":6595,"sourcePath":"1.

This is Antonia. Welcome to week one, where the topic is timeless awareness.\nIn the teachings this week, we will be presented with an overview that shows how all of the teachings fit together and how it is all about recognizing who we are and what we have — our true nature that is perfect and always has been so. Mingyur Rinpoche, in a quite astonishing way, is laying out a map of how all of the Buddha's teachings fit together with the Joy of Living journey and where the teachings on timeless awareness, or our true nature, are coming from.&nbsp;\nBefore commenting more on what we will be practicing this week, I wanted to just pause for a moment and reflect on the power of example because hearing about how people in the past have had similar questions as we are having — What is this? What is the nature of all phenomena? Who are we? Why is our experience the way it is? — and then learning that there are answers to these questions and that they are answers that we too can discover and recognize just brings so much appreciation for me. Acknowledging that these teachings and instructions are available for us here today and that we have the opportunity to take these teachings to heart and recognize timeless awareness for ourselves just brings so much joy.\nIt may be that you want to listen to the teachings that we receive this week more than once because they are really very rich. And we do not just get a conceptual understanding, but we also get direct instructions on how to bring this understanding into our own experience and to really explore it experientially so that we see how all phenomena are emptiness, clarity, and compassion.\nAgain, I really find that the strength of this experiential approach is showing itself in how something that could stay on a conceptual level can really be brought directly into our immediate experience and how this view opens up our experience and awakens genuine wisdom.&nbsp;\nThey are very powerful instructions and teachings, and I really encourage you to take your time with this this week. I am looking forward to hearing how you are finding it all. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.1 Welcome to Timeless Awareness View\" data-href=\"3.6.1 Welcome to Timeless Awareness View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.1 Welcome To Timeless Awareness, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.1 welcome to timeless awareness, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.1 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Timeless Awareness (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Timeless_Awareness_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476647,"modifiedTime":1759272588242,"sourceSize":2831,"sourcePath":"1.

That is the compassion, actually, that manifestation.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nThe union here is of love and compassion. \"Union\" refers to the union of emptiness and clarity, or the union of emptiness and appearance.\nEmptiness helps to open everything up, and clarity is happening. If they were separate, everything would be stuck. If there were emptiness without clarity, and clarity without emptiness, then nothing could happen. Because of their union, everything can happen. However, these three qualities are one, of course, like one person having different aspects. Fire has a heat aspect, a light aspect, and a color aspect, but it is just one flame, right? They are the same thing.\nAt the basic level, whatever is happening now is because of the power of love and compassion — everything. In our lives, if we want to do something, where does this come from? Why do we want to do something? It is because we are looking for happiness. We are looking for something nice, something good. We do not want to suffer. We do not want problems. We do not want obstacles. Wanting to be happy is the basis of love. Not wanting to suffer is the basis of compassion. You learned that in level two. Because of this, we are busy, busy, busy. We try to achieve happiness our entire life. Everything we do is out of love and compassion.\nBut then, that love and compassion are colored by ignorance, aversion, and grasping. The unhealthy sense of self changes things and translates them into something else.\nNow, when we come back home to who we are at our innate level — when we practice emptiness — then love and compassion actually become bigger. They become more profound, more genuine, deeper, and vaster.\nOf course, at the beginning, it might not happen like that. We need to have a trigger. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] The trigger is to think about what we sometimes say: \"The appreciation of emptiness develops love and compassion.\" Or, \"Because of emptiness — emptiness is the reason — we develop love and compassion.\"\nWe practiced this a little bit in the previous course, especially in the application section. Now, we will practice this in our meditation.\nThink about yourself and all beings. Actually, we all are emptiness. Emptiness is very peaceful, beyond, profound, and luminous. It is happiness. It has unchangeable happiness. That is who we are, our real home. But we do not recognize it. We are under the control of ignorance, aversion, and grasping. This creates baseless and meaningless suffering in samsara. Samsara is the circle of suffering.\nThen you will really see this wonderful nature, not only in you but within all beings. By nature, we are all the same. Everybody is lovable. You will have a sense of sweetness towards yourself and towards all beings. We all are worthy of being happy and worthy of being free. Are we not?\nBut we do not recognize this. This is the real meaning of compassion — to see that we do not recognize this. Wanting to help all beings fully recognize their true nature is boundless love, or loving-kindness.\nThe reason for this love and compassion is emptiness. Suffering does not exist. Samsara does not exist. This problem does not exist. Ignorance does not exist. Bondage does not exist. Jail or prison does not exist. It is all like a dream. But we all do not recognize this and therefore suffer. Suffering exists for all beings. When you do not recognize a dream, the dream exists. So, \"May all beings fully recognize their true nature. May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.\"\nOkay. Now, please keep your spine loosely straight, and first rest your mind in open awareness. Open awareness is also the manifestation of love and compassion.\n[Silent meditation]\nIt is not just open awareness — your mind is the manifestation of love and compassion. Your body is the manifestation of love and compassion. Whatever you hear is the manifestation of love and compassion — all the sounds. Whatever you see — all of these objects — are the manifestation of love and compassion. Appreciate that. Have gratitude. Be thankful for your true nature.\n[Silent meditation]\nAll beings have this wonderful nature, but we do not recognize it. We are under the control of ignorance, aversion, and craving. We put ourselves into a prison.\n[Silent meditation]\nSend your love and compassion to all beings. Let yourself and all beings merge in love and compassion.\n[Silent meditation]\n\"May all beings be free. May all beings fully recognize their true nature.\"\n[Silent meditation]\nNow, just rest your mind in open awareness. Know that open awareness is one with love and compassion.\n[Silent meditation]\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n150 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;5 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating with Timeless Awareness&nbsp;by Cortland DahlIn this practice, you will explore timeless awareness and connect with its three qualities of emptiness, clarity, and compassion.&nbsp;\nBegin session Being upright and relaxed, take a moment to find a comfortable posture. Leave your eyes open for this analytical meditation.\nTake a few slow, calming breaths. Notice what is happening in your body.&nbsp;\nNext, completely let go, and rest in open, effortless awareness. You do not need to do anything right now. Simply be natural.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for being here, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice if there is a sense of self present. This could be an identification with the body as the self, or a general feeling of an \"I.\"&nbsp;\nNext, take a look below the surface and see if you can notice anything else about your experience. Perhaps your experience is open, ungraspable, or dream-like. Or, perhaps you are holding onto the sense of self in some way. Whatever your experience is like is totally fine. Reflect on your physical sensations and/or thoughts associated with your sense of self. You do not need to think about it too much. Simply be aware and continue to notice the openness of your experience.&nbsp;\nFrom time to time, look at the sense of self, and examine your experience. Ask yourself, \"Who am I? Where am I? What am I?\" Is there anything that you can find and pinpoint? If not, rest in this non-finding.&nbsp;\nNext, just rest in the ungraspable or open quality of mind. See if you can recognize the inherent, radiant clarity of mind. The openness or ungraspability of mind is infused with the simple quality of knowing. This knowing quality of mind is clarity. You do not need to do anything in particular, but simply see if you can notice the open spaciousness infused with the knowing quality or the presence of mind.&nbsp;\nIf you get distracted, do not worry. The clarity of mind is always present. It is ordinary. You do not need to look for a profound experience, but instead simply recognize the ordinary quality of knowing, and rest.&nbsp;\nNext, as you continue to try to rest in the open, ungraspable quality of mind, see if you can allow it to be infused with compassion. Reflect on the fact that many of us do not recognize who we truly are and how much suffering this non-recognition leads to in our lives. Bring to mind the compassionate motivation to help all beings to recognize their true nature, the empty clarity of mind. If you find it helpful to think of particular people in your life, that is totally fine. You can choose whatever you find helpful at this moment. Allow this motivation to permeate all elements of your experience. If possible, rest directly into the ungraspability or non-finding of the mind. End session Drop all effort, rest, and take in the richness of this experience. Simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche explains that the root of suffering is ignorance, aversion, and attachment. He also says that beings experience suffering due to these three mind states, as they do not recognize their true nature. In the guided meditation, you set the intention to wish that all beings fully recognize their true nature. How does this intention affect your meditation practice? Does it help open the heart and/or loosen your grasping at a solid sense of self?Mingyur Rinpoche explains that the three qualities of timeless awareness are emptiness or ungraspability; clarity or knowing; and compassion. When you explore these, do you notice anything new in how you relate to yourself, others, and your surroundings?Reflect on your meditation and note any important insights, confusions, or experiences that occur when you practice. How might these experiences influence your practice?Tip\nWhen you experience anger or aversion towards someone in your life, look deeper and recognize the fundamental nature of who they are.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.1 Welcome to Timeless Awareness Application\" data-href=\"3.6.1 Welcome to Timeless Awareness Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.1 Welcome To Timeless Awareness, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.1 welcome to timeless awareness, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.1 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (30 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(30_min)_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.1-welcome-to-timeless-awareness-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476641,"modifiedTime":1759272588250,"sourceSize":10104,"sourcePath":"1.

Each and every moment we have the opportunity to connect with a timeless awareness that is not affected in any way by the changing conditions of our lives.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses the:\nlife of the Buddha\nanswer to the Buddha's fundamental question\nthree turnings of the wheel of dharma\nconnection between the union of emptiness and clarity and loving-kindness and compassion\nWatch Read\nIn the life story of the Buddha, it is said that when he was young, the Buddha had questions, such as, \"What is life? Who am I? What is the purpose of being here? What is all this about? All that we see, who we are, all these phenomena — where do they come from?\"\nThe Buddha had these questions. Although the Buddha had a wonderful life — he was a prince, he had a great father and stepmother, a kingdom, luxury, and a palace — he had everything — he was never satisfied with it all. When he was in his twenties, these questions grew stronger and stronger.\nHe then left the palace and went looking for answers. He went throughout India — from the North to the East, and also to the central parts. He learned from various philosophical schools and meditative lineages. He learned everything he could. He was a genius, actually — he learned everything. Sometimes he would become better than the teacher, but he was still not satisfied. The questions were still there.\nThen he thought, in the end, \"I have to really meditate to find the real answers.\" He went to the river Niranjana at a part where there is a forest, and he stayed there for six years meditating. He made a very strong effort and had determination. He achieved so many different&nbsp;dhyanas.&nbsp;Dhyana&nbsp;refers to different stages of meditation — different absorptions. There are eight or nine of them. He achieved them all,&nbsp;but&nbsp;he was still not satisfied.\nOne day he thought, \"Okay, I will just let go. I will let go of everything, and just be with myself. Be 'as it is.'\" When he let go and let everything be as it is, it looked like he had found the answer! It looked like everything came together. Something clicked — everything came together. It was a \"Wow!\" moment, but he could not really describe it.\nHe crossed the river Niranjana and went to a place called Bodh Gaya where he sat under the bodhi tree, to just be \"as it is.\" He then discovered his answer!\nDo you want to know the answer? If you want to know the answer, raise your hand. Now, I will tell you the answer. The answer is . . . \"no answer.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] No answer; no question; no need to meditate; no need to do anything. Just be \"as it is.\"\nThis is actually the whole purpose of these courses — levels one, two, and three. The purpose of all of these is to just be \"as it is.\" You do not have to get rid of anything. You do not have to create anything. You just recognize who you are. Who are you? You are amazing! We actually have what we call \"enlightened qualities.\" Our true nature is perfect. It is what the Buddha called \"buddha nature,\" or \"enlightened nature.\"\nWhen the Buddha recognized this, there was a big \"Wow!\" and he became fully enlightened by recognizing his true nature. The Buddha said, \"This is profound, peaceful, luminous, beyond concept, uncontrived, and natural. If I teach this to others, no one will understand it, so maybe I will just keep silent.\" So he stayed in the forest for a few weeks.\nHe was asked to teach again and again, and so the Buddha then taught. He taught step by step.\nThe first big teaching of the Buddha was mostly about the healthy sense of self. The second big teaching that he taught at Vulture Peak mountain, in India, was about the \"beyond aspect,\" emptiness. Everything is beyond. Empti-ness&nbsp;— it is beyond, yet everything is possible. When he was around seventy years old, he taught the last teaching: luminosity; buddha nature; self beyond self. This is the main focus of the teachings that we are practicing here.\nWhat is buddha nature? Buddha nature has three qualities. It is empty. Sometimes we say that the essence is empty. Our true nature, who we are, or our essence is empty, yet its nature is clarity, manifestation. Everything can manifest. The third quality is the union of emptiness and clarity — the union of emptiness and possibility.\nSo who you are is empty, yet you are not nothing. There are possibilities and potentials that we have already discovered. And emptiness and possibility are one. They are like fire and heat, or water and moisture. You cannot separate fire from heat. They are one.\nOur nature is like that. Everything is the display of emptiness and possibility in union. Everything is like a mere image of emptiness in union with perception, possibility, or phenomena. They are the same thing.\nThis manifests in our lives. We have a body, speech, and a mind. The body is like the empty aspect — \"empty\" is like the ground or the basis. The body is based on feelings and does not have much on the conceptual level, yet it is the base for everything. Your body is the basis for you, isn't it? Speech is like clarity or possibility. In order to talk, we have to use concepts and language. A lot of different conceptual manifestations come with speech, and also with the wind energy in the body. The mind is the union of emptiness and clarity.\nWhen we look at a higher level, there is what we call day and night. Night is the empty aspect — it is&nbsp;beyond. Day is the possibility — the clarity aspect. We need both, so they are in union in our lives.\nThere are male and female. The empty aspect is the feminine. It is beyond. It is soft. It is like a mother; emptiness is the mother of everything — everything comes from emptiness. Then, phenomena and possibilities are the masculine. There is a lot happening. We need both — the union of these two energies.\nWhen we look at the subtle level of energy, there is positive energy and negative energy, sometimes called&nbsp;yin&nbsp;and&nbsp;yang&nbsp;in some traditions. Electricity has positive and negative charges. Everywhere in the entire universe is the manifestation of emptiness, possibility, and their union.\nHere, with this practice, the main focus is on how to practice the union. What is the practice of the union? It is what we call \"love and compassion.\" Emptiness is open, like a mother, and clarity is what is happening. When these two come together, there is compassion. Sometimes we say this union is love and compassion. It is like you and your friend coming together. Why? Because of love, compassion, and care. There is social harmony when everybody gets together and works together. Again, why? It is because of love, care, and compassion. It is like with partners — husband and wife, or boyfriend and girlfriend. They also come together because of love and compassion.\nWhen we look at level 2, what we actually see in the end is that love and compassion are the basis for&nbsp;everything. They are the basis for our thoughts, our feelings, our emotions, and even each movement of the body — each blink of the eye. Do you remember? Everything is happening. Why? Because of love and compassion.\nSometimes, in some texts, they say, \"The essence is empty. The nature is clarity. The union is compassion.\" Everything comes together because of love and compassion.\nWe will practice this, which we sometimes call \"nonconceptual love and compassion practice,\" in the practice session.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that the answer the Buddha discovered to his question was to \"be as it is\" and that there is no need to \"meditate.\" What does this mean to you as a meditator? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that buddha nature consists of emptiness and clarity and that the union of these two aspects manifests as loving-kindness and compassion. If you were to explain the relationship between buddha nature and loving-kindness and compassion to a friend, how would you do so?

All the problems, suffering, and everything else become the path.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nNow, in everyday life, of course, you need to practice emptiness meditation everywhere, any time, under any circumstances. I have mentioned this since level one: we can meditate everywhere, anytime, with anything.\nHere, it is the same with emptiness meditation. You can practice everywhere! With this emptiness meditation, eventually, everything is transformed for you. The negative part, everything that we call \"negative karma,\" the negative emotions, or&nbsp;kleshas, are all purified and transformed into awareness, wisdom, and love and compassion. Try this, and practice again and again.\nOf course, there are a lot of ups and downs at the beginning. But the most important thing in everyday life is that, for the relative level, we need to stay in the healthy sense of self. You are still bound by causes and conditions. You are still bound by interdependence. You are still bound by time. You are getting older every day, no matter what you say. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Isn't that the case, for the relative level? This is because we are not liberated yet. We are not free yet.\nWe cannot free ourselves through force — it comes automatically. Practice emptiness again and again. When the light comes, darkness automatically goes away. You cannot use force to get rid of darkness. It does not work. You have to create wisdom.\nWe have what we sometimes call \"accumulation\" — accumulation of merit, and accumulation of wisdom. Accumulation of wisdom is emptiness meditation. Accumulation of merit means that on the relative level you follow the principle of causes and conditions. You follow ethical conduct, help others, respect others, and are kind.\nWe have a very famous story of a meditator who was meditating in a cave. That person meditated, and to him, it looked like everything was emptiness. The emptiness experience became very strong for him. Then, in the cave, there were a lot of mice, and his food was eaten by the mice so he did not like them. He was really angry at the mice. One time, a big mouse jumped on the table. The meditator got really angry and slowly, slowly grabbed his shoe. He said, \"I am emptiness. Mouse, you are emptiness. The shoe is also emptiness,\" and he hit the mouse. Dead! Suddenly, the mouse was dead. And the person said, \"Death is emptiness. Bad karma is emptiness.\" That is what we call \"nihilism.\" Actually, you do not know emptiness, you just know \"empty.\" \"Emptiness\" means nothing exists, yet it manifests — it is the union of these two.\nTherefore, because of emptiness, everything can manifest. So for the relative level, stay at the relative level. Sometimes we say that your view is free, courageous, and open, but your action should be fine, gentle, and soft. The combination of these is really important.\nWe say, \"Do not let your view follow your action.\" Then you feel, \"Oh, is this is right? Is this is wrong? Am I doing a good thing? Oh, this is not good. Be compassionate. Oh, I do not have compassion. Oh, meditation! Oh, is this generosity? Is this not generosity? Am I a good person? Or am I not a good person.\" We get trapped in that. So do not let your view follow your action. The view has to be free — everything is emptiness! Being a good person is emptiness, being a bad person is emptiness. Good karma is emptiness, bad karma is emptiness. Mistakes are emptiness. Making no mistakes is emptiness. Do not worry, you are okay!\nYour view should be free and fearless, but do not let your action follow your view. Then you might misunderstand emptiness, like that meditator who killed the mouse. That is nihilism. \"Ah yeah, everything is emptiness, so that means everything is nothing, I can do whatever I want. I can steal.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Engaging in stealing, lying, and all these things and then thinking, \"It is emptiness anyway\" does not work.\nTherefore, apply the union of the view and action in your life. This is really important.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nYou can practice emptiness meditation anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances. Often, we forget this due to our habitual tendencies. At the start of each day, think of three to five situations that you may encounter. Experiment with situations that you have not explored before. First, set the intention to recognize the empty nature of the situation as you encounter it. Once you are in the situation, pause and apply emptiness meditation periodically.&nbsp;\nAdditionally, you can alternate the emptiness exercise above with practices aimed at accumulating merit. To do this, at the start of each day, think of someone whom you may encounter. In the beginning, choose someone who it is easier to be helpful towards. Set the intention to be of benefit to this person by recognizing their true nature in the moment. Next, set the intention to pay attention to your own speech and actions as you are around this person. When you encounter this person throughout the day, pause and act on these intentions in whatever way you feel beneficial.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that you cannot force freedom. Rather, it comes naturally, just the way light illuminates darkness. In this section, you are encouraged to engage in practices on the relative level aimed at benefiting others, as well as on the ultimate level, recognizing emptiness throughout the day. Do you find one of these more accessible? Please explain.&nbsp;\nDoes recognizing emptiness in regard to yourself affect your relationships or general sense of connection with others?\nInquiry\nCan you view your next feeling or emotion as a manifestation of wisdom and nonconceptual loving-kindness and compassion?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.2 Beyond the Sense of Self Summary\" data-href=\"3.6.2 Beyond the Sense of Self Summary\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.2 Beyond The Sense Of Self, Application - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.2 beyond the sense of self, application - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.2 Application"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Applying in Daily Life (10 min)","level":2,"id":"Applying_in_Daily_Life_(10_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond the Sense of Self: Application</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_the_Sense_of_Self_Application*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Step 1","level":3,"id":"Step_1_0"},{"heading":"Step 2","level":3,"id":"Step_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-summary.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-application.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476611,"modifiedTime":1759272588285,"sourceSize":6780,"sourcePath":"1.

He says, \"So now we have gone beyond the unhealthy and the healthy sense of self.\" And then he poses the question, \"Do you think so? Or do you feel so? Or has it become so?\"&nbsp;\nAs we near the end of the course and listen to these teachings we could easily feel despondent. Going beyond the unhealthy and the healthy sense of self . . . Maybe there is some thinking . . . Maybe sometimes there is a little bit of feeling. But becoming — maybe that really feels a little bit beyond where we are at!&nbsp;\nWe understand the view, which is to be open and free. And we know that when we do our formal practice, having established a good motivation, we can just let go of the results.&nbsp;\nThe words sound simple, but I imagine that we have all experienced a bit of anticipation — perhaps for some kind of change in our perception — moments of striving, and certainly resistance when what is arising is quite unpleasant.&nbsp;\nAnd yet, the invitation is to see into the nature of whatever is arising, to recognize that, regardless of our experience, the doorway to clear seeing is there the moment we remember to come back to open receptivity.&nbsp;\nI really liked the analogy Rinpoche used in one of his previous teachings in which he compared the unhealthy and the healthy sense of self as being like ice and water.\nIn the moment of reification, if we remember the view, the ice instantaneously melts, and we open to the possibility of something new.\nGoing beyond the unhealthy and the healthy sense of self might seem a little bit beyond where we are, but I encourage you to have a bit of faith, and trust in the guidance you will be given. Relax and give it a go. &nbsp;\nWe demystify what might seem beyond our understanding by working with our experience in a direct way, by touching into awareness — &nbsp;the golden thread of awareness that never changes. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.2 Beyond the Sense of Self View\" data-href=\"3.6.2 Beyond the Sense of Self View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.2 Beyond The Sense Of Self, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.2 beyond the sense of self, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.2 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Beyond the Sense of Self (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Beyond_the_Sense_of_Self_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476605,"modifiedTime":1759272588292,"sourceSize":2619,"sourcePath":"1.

You'll recognize that your essential nature cannot be harmed or destroyed.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nWatch Read\nBy practicing this emptiness meditation again and again, what is the result? What is the benefit? Liberation, freedom, and happiness. I have mentioned this many times before.\nI will give you one simple example of not being liberated, meaning that we are stuck, that we are bound by subject and object, concepts, and suffering. And, on the physical level, time, matter, direction, \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"both,\" and \"neither.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] We are bound by so many things, right? The law of causality binds us also. So we are not free.\nThat is what we call \"being stuck in ice.\" If you are in the middle of ice, then what can you do? You cannot do anything — you are frozen. You are bound by ice. But then, if the ice slowly, slowly melts away, you can begin to move a little bit. Maybe you are connecting with the healthy sense of self — the true relative, not the fake relative. You are coming from the fake relative to the true relative, and you can move a little bit.\nIf the ice fully turns to water, with a very good temperature, very clean and flexible, then you can move. You are really free, not frozen. That is the example of liberation. The water and the ice are the same element, the element of water. But when the water is frozen, you are not free. When the water becomes water, becomes flexible, then you are free.\nActually, when you fully recognize that everything is emptiness, that is how we get real liberation. We are not bound by subject and object and concepts. We are not bound by time and matter. We are not bound by \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"both.\" We are not bound by being born, getting old, sickness, and death. We cannot die, because our true nature is unborn. When you achieve the direct realization of emptiness, then death and dying become like an illusion, like a dream. But that is your own perception. If other people look at you, you will die. They will see you die. And when other people look at your body, they will see the same ordinary body. They will not see your body like the moon's reflection in a lake.\nTherefore, it will take some time. But the really important thing for meditation is to not care about liberation. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] \"When will I achieve liberation?\" Do not care about it. Actually, you&nbsp;are&nbsp;liberated right now. You are enlightened right now. You are emptiness right now. We say, \"Who taught emptiness? The Buddha.\" And we say, \"Whether the Buddha taught emptiness or not, it does not matter. We are emptiness. Whether you believe in emptiness or not, it does not matter. We are emptiness.\"\nI heard one of my friends say, \"Whether you believe in gravity or not, gravity is always there.\" If you walk, if you fall from a cliff, you will hit the ground. Whether you believe in gravity or not, it is there. By nature, we are all emptiness, we are all perfect.\nDo not care about which level you are at — understanding, experiential, or direct realization. \"I need to be liberated! I need to be liberated! I need to be liberated!\" Do not care. The more you chase it, the more it goes away. But actually, it is just here. So what do we need to recognize? That you do not need to liberate anything. Then you are liberated already.\nWe will do the same meditation practice here to see the self as emptiness. And then, we will rest after that. When you rest, you do not need to analyze. Just rest with what we call the \"flow of emptiness,\" the \"feeling of emptiness,\" or the \"notion of emptiness.\"\nWhen we meditate on the breath in level one, we rest on the breath, right? When we meditate on sounds, our mind rests on the sounds. We are being with sound. It is the same here. Instead of using sounds or the breath, here we use emptiness. We are being with emptiness. We rest with emptiness.\nPlease keep your spine loosely straight. Keep the emptiness spine loosely straight. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Relax the emptiness body, and rest in the emptiness of open awareness.\nJust be in emptiness.\nYou are emptiness. All phenomena are emptiness.\nIt does not matter whether you are seeing emptiness, experiencing emptiness, or recognizing emptiness or not. Do not care. The moment you want to meditate with emptiness, emptiness is right there.\nSometimes we call this \"zero emptiness meditation,\" meaning that you want to meditate on emptiness. Even though you do not experience emptiness, you do not see emptiness, you have the intention of wanting to meditate on emptiness. And you have a general idea about emptiness already. So do not care about whether you really experience emptiness or not.\n[Silent meditation]\nIt may become the same as open awareness meditation. Be with that.\nSome thoughts or emotions may arise. Look at the nature of those thoughts and emotions. They are also emptiness.\nIf pain comes in your knees or back, look at the pain. It is also emptiness. Your back is emptiness. If you want to move, you can move. No problem. Do not worry.\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n180 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;6 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating with Beyond the Sense of Self&nbsp;by Myoshin KelleyIn this practice, you will rest in the recognition of emptiness with whatever phenomena appear.\nBegin session Begin by finding your posture. Allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to be at ease and relaxed. Recognize that sensations do not inherently exist, yet they manifest.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to cultivate a compassionate motivation. Set the intention to do this practice in order to be of benefit to all beings. Recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Simply rest in awareness itself — empty in nature, yet clear and knowing. Main practice First, take a few moments to notice what is appearing in your mind. As sounds, sights, or thoughts appear, simply look and recognize that they are empty in essence.\nEach time a network of experiences arises, look and notice that the experiences, too, do not inherently exist.\nIt is totally fine if your understanding of emptiness seems intellectual or conceptual at this point. Just stay with your intention, and allow the practice to unfold naturally.&nbsp;\nEach time you experience grasping at appearances and solidify them, reflect that this experience, too, is empty in essence.&nbsp;\nWhen appearances begin to dissolve and seem less solid, fear may emerge. Reflect that this experience, too, is empty in essence.\nEmptiness is the ground of possibility, in which all things can appear. Rest within this recognition. End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Mingyur Rinpoche suggests that you simply set the correct motivation and then let go of any expectations in your emptiness practice.

Then, slowly, slowly, your body, what you see now — within time and matter and perceived as solid — is gone. Your body is just like the moon's reflection in a lake. It is everywhere and nowhere.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe process of going beyond the sense of self\nthe three stages of understanding the principle of emptiness\nmediative experiences with regards to horizontal and vertical liberation\nthe benefits of cultivating direct realization of emptiness\nWatch Read\nNow, we have gone beyond the unhealthy and the healthy sense of self. Do you&nbsp;think&nbsp;so? Or do you&nbsp;feel&nbsp;so? Or has it become so? There are three things here. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Thinking, feeling, and becoming. We call these the \"understanding level,\" \"experiential level,\" and \"direct realization level.\"&nbsp;\nTo recognize emptiness, we have three stages. Right now, we are at the idea level, the thinking level. Although there are a lot of experiential practices, they are still vague. In real life, it does not look like they provide so much benefit. Your feelings do not change much. Everything feels solid, touchy. It is still easy to explode, easy to burn, easy to freeze, and easy to disappear. It is still the same at the feeling level. And then we have the perception level — what you see, hear, touch. It seems as solid as before. It does not change much on the perception level.\nSo we need to go through these three steps to go beyond the healthy and the unhealthy sense of self. It takes time.\nBeyond both the unhealthy and the healthy sense of self, what happens is that your mind is beyond concept. \"Ha.\" [Mingyur Rinpoche stops and gazes outward for a moment.] The sense of \"me\" — when you look for it, you cannot find it.&nbsp;Yet&nbsp;it is not nothing. You can see and hear, and there are thoughts, emotions, feelings, a body, images, and phenomena. Everything is there.\nBut then there are personality differences, or some kinds of differences timing-wise on some occasions. Because of different personalities, some of you might have horizontal liberation, the gap. You can look at the \"me\" and not find it, yet it is&nbsp;somebody&nbsp;who cannot find it. There is clarity there. For that, there is a gap, so you will not really experience&nbsp;kleshas&nbsp;and suffering so much during that. There is peacefulness, calmness, love, awareness, compassion, and wisdom. They are all there, but you will not experience the monkey mind or kleshas. There is a gap, right? Great! Be with that.&nbsp;\nOr some of you, when you look at the self, cannot really pinpoint it, grab it, or identify it. This is just like seeing things in a mirage or seeing a rainbow or the moon's reflection. Yet the body does not disappear. The grasping to the body, the fixed idea of the body, the attachment to the body — those are gone. But there is a body, there is a mind, and there are phenomena.&nbsp;Yet&nbsp;you see phenomena as emptiness. You experience phenomena as emptiness. That is vertical liberation.\nIn the meditation experience, things will not disappear. Emotions may not disappear. Ignorance does disappear. Not knowing emptiness disappears. You know emptiness. Otherwise, kleshas, hatred, or anger may come. Dullness and confusion may come. But when you look at the dullness or confusion, they are emptiness. This is the beginning of liberation.\nFor these three stages, we have an example. If you want to learn about the moon, you can learn about the moon from a painting in a book, you can learn about the moon through the reflection of the moon, and you can learn about the moon from the early crescent moon, the thinnest moon.\nAccording to the lunar calendar, on the second or third day, you can see a tiny moon. That is the real moon, but tiny. That is the third step. At that time, you are recognizing emptiness. It is the first level of liberation, or freedom. The real freedom. Until then, you intellectually understand it, but emotionally you do not understand it. Feeling-wise, you do not understand. Physically, you do not understand emptiness.\nWhen we are at an understanding level, there are a lot of ups and downs, the same as in level one, when you practice awareness meditation. Sometimes, we feel like it is getting worse, right? The waterfall experience. Some days, you see everything as emptiness, other days you do not. You see everything as solid and strong.\nFor example, when you practice with hatred, you think, \"Hatred is emptiness, I am emptiness, and the cause or the object of hatred is emptiness.\" Then hatred transforms into wisdom, but not for very long. It is just for a few seconds. Then hatred comes back, sometimes stronger than before. Very strong. \"Oh, again, yes, emptiness.\" Hatred again liberates into wisdom for a few seconds. Then it comes back as normal hatred. It is like that at the beginning. With suffering also, there are a lot of ups and downs.\nSome people might have fear, of course. Fear is a good sign. Why is there fear? Because the unhealthy sense of self is departing now. We have an example to illustrate that: say you have a very bad friend who is always talking to you very nicely — \"I am doing this for you, this is for you\" — but he is actually trying to kill you, to poison you, and to make the biggest obstacles for you. But at the same time, he is very nice. \"I am doing this for you.\" Your life becomes miserable because of this bad friend.\nOne day, you recognize this, and you leave your bad friend. In the beginning, you might have fear, or feel lonely and insecure. But do not worry, you have a good friend. What is that good friend? The healthy sense of self is a very good friend. And then the best friend is the luminous self, the self beyond self. Do not worry about letting go of the bad friend. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But sometimes you might have fear. Sometimes fear comes at a feeling level. \"I do not know why I am having this fear. I have never felt this fear before. Wow!\" You feel a huge wave of fear. That is good. Do not worry about that. The important thing is that you have to recognize that it is a good sign.\nOr sometimes you feel confused. Some people vomit or have headaches. Some people feel very happy and want to cry. \"Wow! This is so wonderful.\" There is a feeling of joy and happiness. It is like that. There are ups and downs.\nThen, when you practice, again and again, the second stage is what we call the \"experiential stage.\" So now, emptiness is not only on the intellectual level, but it has come into your feelings, into your being. Images, reason, and voices disappear. What do you have? Experience. A feeling of emptiness.\nWhen you look around, you really see that things are like the moon's reflection. You are so happy on a deeper level and have no fear. A real joy arises within. The joy of freedom. The joy of fearlessness. There are still ups and downs, but the ups and downs do not bother you. The ups are emptiness, and the downs are emptiness. Happiness is emptiness, suffering is emptiness. A good life is emptiness, a life that is not good is emptiness. For emptiness, everything is equal.\nOn what we call the \"understanding level,\" you learn about the moon from the painting. First is the painting, the intellectual level. You think, \"This is emptiness.\" There are words, images, sensations, and beliefs. Great! But that is not the real moon. It is a painted moon. The painted moon really helps us to learn about the moon, doesn't it? The painted moon in a book. But that is not the real moon. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] Yet it has similar qualities, similar color and shape, as the real moon. So it helps lead us to the real moon.\nThen, one day, you go out and look at the lake and see the moon's reflection in the lake. \"Ah! That is the real moon. The painted moon is not the real moon.\" Now you are learning about the moon from the reflection. And that reflection is much better than the painted moon. It is more alive and very clear. All the qualities up there in the moon in the sky can be seen in the reflection. That is the experiential level, the feeling. \"Ah!\" It comes into your body and into your being.\nStill, you do not have the direct realization of emptiness yet. It is not the real moon yet.\nOne day, you go out and look up. According to the lunar calendar, the second phase is a crescent moon. You see a tiny moon up there. \"Ah! That is the real moon.\" In the water, there is only the reflection. At that moment, what happens is what we call \"direct realization of emptiness.\" You experience emptiness not just on the intellectual level, and not just by feeling. You see yourself as emptiness. The wisdom of emptiness comes into the senses, into the eyes, ears, nose, etc. When you touch something, you recognize emptiness. You hear, and you hear sounds as emptiness.\nNow, you do not need to meditate. The meditator and the meditation become one. Suffering — you see suffering as emptiness. Happiness — happiness is emptiness. You cannot really explain it in words. But, at that time, real happiness comes. Samsara becomes nirvana at that moment.\nBut we are not fully enlightened yet. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] After that, we still have nine levels to achieve in order to have a full moon in the sky. To see the full moon is full enlightenment. We see our true nature fully. That takes time. To see the full moon in this one lifetime is very difficult. But direct realization is possible. It is quite difficult but possible.\nHopefully, we will all recognize the full moon in this life.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche says that the three stages of understanding emptiness are like learning about the moon (1) from a painting of the moon in a book; (2) by seeing the moon's reflection in a lake; and (3) by seeing the actual moon in the sky. With this example as the basis, how would you explain the three stages of understanding emptiness to a friend? Question 2\nWhen you begin to let go of the unhealthy sense of self, Mingyur Rinpoche explains that the process is like letting go of an unhealthy friend — you might experience a sense of fear or insecurity, and/or what is called the \"waterfall experience.\" When you begin to get to know the healthy and luminous self, how are you experiencing the process of letting go? Points to remember:\nThe process of understanding the principle of emptiness includes three stages: (1) the intellectual level; (2) the experiential level; and (3) the direct realization level.\nExperiencing strong emotions or suffering when letting go of the unhealthy sense of self is a good sign. The important point is to recognize this.\nOne of the secondary benefits of the experiential level of understanding emptiness is to experience joy and happiness at a deeper level.\nThe wisdom of emptiness is embodied at the level of direct realization. This means that samsara becomes nirvana.\nTip\nSimply know that if you recognize it, the nature of reality is emptiness. If you do not recognize it, the nature of reality is emptiness.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nan experiential exercise to look at the movements of mind\nthe law of cause and effect from the perspective of modern science\nthe principle of emptiness and appearance with regard to Buddhist teachings\nabout the three turnings of the wheel of dharma The Joy of Living, pp. 66–73 (Ch. 4:&nbsp;\"An Exercise in Emptiness\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.2 Beyond the Sense of Self Meditation\" data-href=\"3.6.2 Beyond the Sense of Self Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.2 Beyond The Sense Of Self, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.2 beyond the sense of self, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.2 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Beyond the Sense of Self: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Beyond_the_Sense_of_Self_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (12 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(12_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.2-beyond-the-sense-of-self-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476587,"modifiedTime":1759272588311,"sourceSize":12435,"sourcePath":"1.

Just be with the self beyond self or luminous self.\nWhen you go out, what immediately happens is that the \"me\" arises, you know? \"That is annoying.\" \"I really like that!\" \"That is terrible.\" \"Maybe I did something wrong.\" You worry and worry. Or you get stressed: \"My to-do list!\" \"What do other people think of me?\" \"What will he think?\" \"What will she think?\"\nAnd then you change into a lazy \"me\" and later an excited \"me.\" You have ups and downs. So, look at the \"me\" — it is emptiness. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But it is not nothing — you can have everything, right? A dreamlike, lazy \"me,\" a dreamlike, good \"me,\" and a dreamlike, bad \"me.\" But when you look at the essence of the bad \"me\" or the good \"me\" as emptiness, then you are not the bad \"me.\" The power of the bad \"me\" disappears. The five emotions, as I mentioned before, transform into the five wisdoms. Suffering transforms into wisdom. Then, it manifests as awareness, love and compassion, and of course wisdom. You become more open, flexible, and free.\nThe really important thing is the fear. At a deeper level, when we try to look for a permanent, single, and strong \"me,\" we will always have fear and insecurities. You know? You may think something like, \"This is not enough.\" \"Something is incomplete or missing.\" \"I am lonely.\" These go away. Once they slowly, slowly go away, you will feel really happy. Inside and outside are the same. Home and outside are the same.&nbsp;\nTry that. Then, if you try to practice again and again, there may be a \"wow!\" once in a while. Or, once in a while, fear may come. Once in a while, a strong movement of emotions may come. That is okay. Do not worry.&nbsp;\nOf course now, as I mentioned before, the understanding level may become the experiential level. One day, \"Wow!\" Direct realization. Emptiness is no longer just an idea or feeling. You fully become emptiness. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] But you do not disappear. Samsara becomes nirvana. That moment is what we call \"direct realization.\" You are not fully enlightened yet. There are nine levels after that. Then you become fully enlightened.\nWhen you become fully enlightened, there is no difference between your body, your mind, and outer phenomena. Now, the \"me\" related to body and mind is tiny. You are trapped in concept, time, and matter. But when you are fully enlightened, you are everywhere and nowhere. From your perspective, you fully recognize your true nature. Love and compassion, awareness, and wisdom are fully manifest. And then what happens is that you will continue to benefit many beings. Of course, this body [Mingyur Rinpoche points at himself], will expire when you die. But from your own perception, there is no death, really. So you will be of benefit to countless beings.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice ExercisesTake a moment to reflect on times and places in which you intend to practice during your day. Think of times when you anticipate your mind to be naturally calm and still, as well as times when your mind is active and busy. You can choose a mundane activity for the practice — something that is neither particularly challenging nor less cognitively demanding. Whenever you decide to do this, simply look at the sense of self. Remember, awareness is always with you, no matter what state your mind is in, even when you feel annoyed, stressed, or insecure. When you look at the self, examine what it is like in that particular moment. You might experience it as dream-like. Remember, it is totally normal to get distracted or carried away by daily activities; when you notice you were distracted, you are already reconnected with awareness. At the end of the day, check in to see how the practice went, and set your intention for the next day.Journal Reflection Questions\nAs you look at the sense of self or the \"me\" throughout the day, do you experience something that you did not experience before?&nbsp;\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that when looking at the deeper level of the sense of self, there can be experiences of ups and downs. What was your experience like? What strategies will you use to continue this practice?\nInquiry\nWho is reading this sentence?

Welcome to this week, where we will be exploring a new practice called \"movement, stillness, and awareness.\"&nbsp;\nOne of the threads that are running through the Joy of Living teachings is that what we may perceive as problems that are standing in the way of experiencing inner freedom or authentic joy are actually not problems, but our richness. And that also goes for the sense of self.&nbsp;\nPersonally, this view, and the sense of potential that it brings, has been really crucial for me for continuing to explore these teachings. We have heard again and again that that which characterizes our situation, when we lose the sense of openness and spaciousness, is that we do not recognize what we have, and we get caught in an unhealthy sense of self. We have also seen and experienced how our confused ways of perceiving are not constant or solid. In many ways, we can say that the practice is to be in a way that allows gaps in this confusion.\nIn this section, we will be introduced to a very profound practice, \"movement, stillness, and awareness,\" as I mentioned. And again we will be exploring the sense of self and seeing how it is a door to wisdom. I wish you all the best with the teachings and the practice. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.3 Stillness Movement and Awareness View\" data-href=\"3.6.3 Stillness Movement and Awareness View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.3 Stillness, Movement, And Awareness, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.3 stillness, movement, and awareness, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.3 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Stillness, Movement, and Awareness (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Stillness,_Movement,_and_Awareness_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476562,"modifiedTime":1759272588333,"sourceSize":1954,"sourcePath":"1.

There are two types of meditation here. First, you can ask a question: \"Who am I?\" \"Who is this?\" \"Where am I?\" Begin with a little bit of analytical meditation. And in the second type you do not need to ask a question. Be with the feeling, the sense of me, the notion of me, or the idea of me. Be with it. Okay? It is very easy.\nNow, please keep your spine loosely straight. Relax your body, and rest your mind in open awareness meditation.&nbsp;\n[Silent Meditation]\nNow, you can look at the \"me\" by asking a question or not asking a question. It does not matter. Maybe for some of you, the moment you ask a question or feel the \"me,\" there becomes a gap in the mind. You cannot find it. But it is not nothing — you can still see and hear. You will not become unconscious. Everything is present, yet you cannot discover or grab it.&nbsp;\nBe with that. Or some of you can see the \"me\" as an idea, the pieces, how it is changing, and from different perspectives. But the nature of all of these is empty. Your body is like your own reflection in the mirror. Your speech is like an echo. Your mind is like a mirage. That is \"movement:\" seeing things while they appear as empty. They appear dreamlike, there is a dreamlike coming and going. Or you cannot really find anything. That is \"stillness.\" Or things are coming like in a dream, or like a rainbow in the sky — that is \"movement.\" It does not matter — both are good.\nWhen you look, you will have either of these two experiences. And if you mix them, it is also okay. If you feel like they are mixed together, that is also okay. If you do not know which one you have right now, it is also okay. Do not worry about it. And do not try to look too much, either. Like you almost want to look, or as if you are looking. There is nothing to look at anyway, right?&nbsp;\nNow, just be. Whether there is stillness or movement does not matter. Just be with it.&nbsp;\n[Silent Meditation]\nOkay.

Simply rest.\nBefore beginning the main practice, reflect on your motivation for doing this practice, and recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation. Main practice First, notice the current state of your mind. Is it calm and peaceful? Is it active, with a lot of thoughts? Or somewhere in between? Simply observe whatever state the mind is in right now.&nbsp;\nNow, whether your mind is calm and still, or active and in motion, look to see if you can be aware of whatever the state is. There is no particular thing to do — simply be aware of it.&nbsp;\nRemember, it is normal to get distracted. When you notice that you were distracted, you are reconnecting with awareness in that exact moment. Whether the mind is calm or active, both states are expressions of awareness. Just rest in this ever-present awareness.&nbsp;\nIf your mind is settled and calm, take a moment to look at the mind directly. See if there is a sense of self present. If so, where and what is the experience of the sense of self? If you can find it, you do not need to hold onto it. If you cannot find it, rest in the non-finding.&nbsp;\nIf your mind becomes busy and active, use this as an opportunity to examine your thoughts and perceptions. Examine what it is like when the mind is busy. Notice how everything is constantly changing — fluid and dynamic — and rest in that.&nbsp;\nThe stillness and movement of the mind are both playing out as expressions of awareness. Rest in awareness, whether there is stillness or movement. End session Let go of the meditation, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. Do you have a preference between the experience of stillness and movement? Please explain how/why.As you practice stillness, movement, and awareness, does something shift with regard to your initial preference? If so, what is this experience like?What stood out most to you during this practice? What do you find easiest and most challenging about this practice?Inquiry\nIs awareness present in this moment?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.3 Stillness Movement and Awareness Application\" data-href=\"3.6.3 Stillness Movement and Awareness Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.3 Stillness, Movement, And Awareness, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.3 stillness, movement, and awareness, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.3 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Stillness, Movement, and Awareness: Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Stillness,_Movement,_and_Awareness_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 3","level":4,"id":"Reflection_3_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476556,"modifiedTime":1759272588340,"sourceSize":6044,"sourcePath":"1.

This is quite similar, but here, we come at it from a little bit different perspective.\nNormally, in level one, we just look at thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and whatever else that comes and goes. When we look at them and cannot see them, there is a gap, and we be with the gap. We just be with awareness itself. If suddenly something comes again, we are just to be aware of it. That is with regard to level one.&nbsp;\nNormally, I talk about two liberations. Horizontal liberation means that there is a gap. When you look at thoughts and emotions and cannot find them — they disappear — there is a gap, right? In between the past and the future, there is a gap.\nThen, when you look at thoughts and emotions and can see them — they do not disappear — that is vertical liberation. That liberation comes front and back. Space comes front and back. The gap comes front and back. That is what I call \"vertical.\" It is the same as when you can see the river, that means you are out of the river. The river is still there. It does not disappear. Or, when you see the mountains, you are out of the mountains. As I mentioned before, the traditional example is that if you want to see the mountainside, you have to go to the other mountainside and look at it. So, if you see thoughts and emotions, great!\nThe basis for both liberations is awareness. Awareness means being with what is. This is for level one.&nbsp;\nNow, we have gone through and learnt a lot about wisdom. We have gone through a lot of analysis and done analytical meditation. What we discover here is emptiness. Here, we are not just looking at thoughts and emotions, we are looking at the thinker. Who is the thinker? \"Me, me, me,\" isn't it? When we look at the thinker, \"me,\" what happens? The five types of experiences, right? I mentioned this at the beginning and throughout this course: the main focus is, \"Who am I? Where am I? Who is this?\" Because the \"me, me, me\" is the one who is suffering. The one who is having panic is \"me,\" the one who is having stress is \"me,\" the one who is having pain is \"me,\" the one who is having anger, jealousy, desire, pride, and ignorance is \"me,\" and the one who is depressed or has low self-esteem or conflicts is \"me.\" All this suffering and kleshas, comes from \"me,\" especially when perceiving \"me\" mistakenly as permanent, singular, and independent. Then all this suffering and kleshas become very strong. Normally, we never look at that. Of course, we know there is a \"me.\" \"Ah, that is 'me.'\" \"What about me?\" We are always saying, \"What about me?\" But we do not look at the \"me,\" actually. We are lost in the \"me.\" Like when we are lost in a river, of course we know that we are in the river, but we cannot look at the river, because we are in the river.\nWhen we are lost in the unhealthy sense of \"me,\" we do not see it. Now, how can we get free from this unhealthy sense of self or \"me\"? The only way is by watching it or just being with the \"me.\" You do not have to do anything. It is very easy, actually. You do not have to try to get rid of the bad \"me.\" You do not need to make a new \"me,\" a good \"me,\" or a positive \"me.\" You do not need to do anything. If it is positive, it is okay. If it is negative, it is okay. A bad \"me\" is okay. A good \"me\" is okay. A so-so \"me\" is okay. [Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.] All the \"me's\" are okay. The important thing is to be with it and look at it.&nbsp;\nThen what will happen? I mentioned this before. When the light comes, darkness will automatically go away. There is no need to push or fight with darkness. It will go away automatically. Light is more powerful than darkness. It will burn all of these kleshas, or negative emotions. And what will happen? They will transform.\nWe have gone through all of this about wisdom. Now, what we need to do is to look at the object, the \"me,\" and then maybe we cannot find it. When you look at the feeling or sense of \"me,\" sometimes you cannot find it. The idea of \"me...\" there is a gap. That is the stillness here. If you cannot find it, great! Be with that.&nbsp;\nOr when you look, you may find the unhealthy sense of \"me.\" But that is around here, or here [Mingyur Rinpoche gestures toward his chest and head], and that is just an idea. We think that it is single, but that is an idea. It is a combination of thoughts and feelings, isn't it? There are pieces. What we are seeing are pieces. What we see are different perspectives, interdependence. What we are seeing is changing and changing.\nThen when we look more and more into that, it is empty and baseless in the end, yet it is not nothing. There is still a \"me.\" It is an impermanent \"me,\" an interdependent \"me,\" a multiplicity \"me.\" The grasping disappears. The grasping of perceiving things as truly existent disappears. But the dreamlike \"me\" is still there. One's body is like the moon's reflection in water. One's speech is like an echo. And one's mind is like a mirage. It is there. No problem. That is \"movement.\"&nbsp;\nNow, with movement, when you are looking at the \"me,\" you can see everything. Even if you do not see it as emptiness, it is okay. You may see the multiplicity, pieces, interdependence, or impermanence. Or even if you believe that it is permanent, it is just a belief, a feeling, an idea. Those are also made up of pieces.&nbsp;\nIt does not matter. When you look at the self, there may be a gap. If you cannot find it, good! Selfless. There is a gap, but you do not disappear. You recognize that it is not there. You are experiencing the gap. It is not nothing, yet you cannot grab it. There is stillness, a gap. Wonderful! Or, if many things appear, like a rainbow in the sky, great!\nThe basis for both of these is awareness, the knowing, and knowing reality is the wisdom here. Now we call it \"wisdom.\" In level one, we called it \"awareness.\" They are different names, but are actually the same. Awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom are the same thing. Knowing both is wisdom.\nThese are vipashyana meditations. Nowadays, there is a very famous vipashyana movement. However, there are three types of vipashyana. Here, we are discussing two of them. One kind of vipashyana consists of seeing the body, feeling, mind, and phenomena as changing and impermanent, and to be \"as it is.\" This is the Theravada type of vipashyana. We already practiced that at the beginning. For us here, that is the healthy sense of self. And in the end, when we look at the nature of the body and the mind, we cannot find it. It is empty, yet it is not nothing. It appears like a reflection in a mirror. That is the Mahayana vipashyana, which we call \"emptiness vipashyana.\"&nbsp;\nThere are a lot of practices like this in the Mahayana tradition, like in the Zen, the Chan tradition. In the Zen tradition, they would ask: \"Who am I?\" \"Who is this?\" \"Who is having pain?\" \"Who is being happy?\" \"Who recites Buddha's name?\" \"Who am I?\" \"Who is this?\" And the Zen tradition does not give an answer, right away. The answer comes through one's experiences, and the teacher will not describe them. In Tibetan Buddhism, we mention what experience will come, and then we teach the next step. There is a step-by-step practice. But the meaning is the same.&nbsp;\nThen, we have the Path of Liberation. These three Joy of Living levels are secular. Everybody can practice them. And in the Path of Liberation, we deeply explore the nature of awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that we experience suffering and negative emotions because of getting lost in the sense of \"me.\" He teaches that our task is to examine the thinker&nbsp;or the emotioner&nbsp;as the object of analytical meditation by being with it. How would you explain the difference between getting lost in the \"me\" and being with the \"me\"?\nPoints to remember:\nInstead of identifying with the \"me,\" you can transform any sense of self into wisdom by recognizing its essence.\nThe gap experience is called \"stillness.\"\nThe dream-like experience of seeing one's body as the moon's reflection in a lake, one's speech as an echo, and one's mind as a mirage is called \"movement.\"&nbsp;\nWhat underlies both stillness and movement of the mind is wisdom.\nTip\nRecognize that both the stillness and movement of the mind are the manifestations of wisdom.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nabout the principles of modern science with regard to the nature of matter&nbsp;\nthe two types of the Buddha's teachings: theory and practice\nabout the relevance of modern science and Buddhism to each other The Joy of Living, pp. 73–75 (Ch. 4:&nbsp;\"The Freedom of Probability\")\nDefinition\nVipashyana:\nThe Sanskrit term&nbsp;vipashyana&nbsp;is often translated as \"insight,\" \"special seeing,\" or \"clear seeing.\"\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.3 Stillness Movement and Awareness Meditation\" data-href=\"3.6.3 Stillness Movement and Awareness Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.3 Stillness, Movement, And Awareness, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.3 stillness, movement, and awareness, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.3 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (20 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(20_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Stillness, Movement, and Awareness: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Stillness,_Movement,_and_Awareness_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (3 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(3_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.3-stillness-movement-and-awareness-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476545,"modifiedTime":1759272588355,"sourceSize":10239,"sourcePath":"1.

What we call our \"view\" is free, open, and fearless, because everything is emptiness, right? There is nothing to be afraid of. You are emptiness. Suffering is emptiness. Samsara is emptiness. Samsara is nirvana.\nThe view is free and open, but right now, we have not achieved that level yet, so we are in the relative level. Our body and mind are both still bound in the relative level, but we are beginning to see some cracks of light of the ultimate truth, the self beyond self. It is still on the idea level, but that is okay. Accept it as an idea.\nIn the relative level, we need to stay in the true relative level, that is, to stay with the pieces, to really respect causes and conditions in whatever you do in your life. We respect the interdependence of everything. If compassion does not come spontaneously, it is okay. Try to meditate on love and compassion, the same as in level two.&nbsp;\nWork with other people. In your home, be with your \"home self,\" as a parent, husband, wife, or kid. At the workplace, be a student, staff member, the boss, or whatever else, and be with that. But do not bring the \"boss me\" from the company into your home, and do not bring your \"home me\" to the office. Being flexible is really important.&nbsp;\nAnd if you really ask yourself who you are, you just do not know. \"Are you Mingyur Rinpoche?\" \"Ah, yes yes!\" \"Are you sure you are Mingyur Rinpoche?\" \"No.\" Right? At a deeper level, it is emptiness. But, on the relative level, there is interdependence, benefit, function, and the need to take care of your friends and family. The \"friend-self\" is wonderful. The family-self is wonderful. The \"staff-self\" is wonderful. The \"boss-self,\" or whatever else. The most important thing is to be like a friend to everybody, to be like a family member to everybody.\nSo, in social situations, that kind of self is totally fine. Sometimes people think \"Oh, I cannot find who I am! In the end, I am emptiness, so it seems like I am imitating. Isn't that dishonest?\"\nActually, it is all honest. Emptiness is true, but if we try to create this permanent, interdependent, singular self, and try to manipulate other people and try to maintain our sense of self by lying and not being honest, that is fake, actually. That is not our real self.&nbsp;\nTherefore, sometimes we call it a \"dance.\" If we know how to dance with ourselves, then that is really colorful, dramatic, peaceful, creative, flexible, happy, and open.&nbsp;\nBring all this into your life — the \"self\" with awareness, the \"self\" with love and compassion, the \"self\" with wisdom — in the relative level. On the ultimate level, be with the luminous self.\nThese exercises are meant to support you in integrating your study and practice with your work, relationships, and the mundane routines of daily life.Daily-Life Practice Exercises\nAt the beginning of the day, reflect on the \"roles\" you play throughout the day. A role could include being a parent, sibling, partner, child, friend, colleague, teacher, nurse, or electrician. Take a moment to set an intention to recognize the sense of self at the level of relative reality. For example, when you encounter a situation as a caretaker, recognize yourself as the embodiment of awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom. Remember, you do not need to change your daily routine or activity, but rather infuse them with the view that you are already fundamentally free, open, and wholesome.\nAlternatively, reflect on the transition between the different roles you play. For example, you might play the role of an employee or employer at work, and then play the role of a spouse or parent at home. Try noticing what is beneath the surface-level experience of playing certain roles.\nJournal Reflection Questions\nWe often have propensities for certain aspects of the path. As you explore bringing awareness, compassion, and wisdom into daily life, does one aspect seem more prominent than the others? Please explain.&nbsp;\nAs you play a variety of roles in daily life, you can be creative in the process of exploring your fundamental nature. Is there any area in which you need more support?

We know we cannot arrange things to be the way we would like them to be. And yet, the desire for things to be a certain way continues to arise.\nBut what if we can shift our attitude? What if we can expand our view in the moment we recognize our clinging?&nbsp;\nI have heard Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, an English nun, well known for her 12-year retreat in a cave in North India, say, \"You say 'obstacle' — it is an obstacle. You say 'opportunity' — it is an opportunity.\"\nJoseph Goldstein, a well-known teacher of insight meditation, wrote in one of his books, \"When we are at the edge of what we are willing to be with, what we are willing to accept, right there is precisely the most interesting place of practice, because that is where we have set a limitation, a boundary for ourselves. If we can see that and recognize it, then that is the place to work, to look, to explore. That is the place to open.\"\nBringing the practice into the thick of daily life, as we touch into feelings that call to be explored in a way that is tender and courageous, we deepen our capacity for compassion and insight.&nbsp;\nAs we learn to be gentle, to not push our experience but to touch into the empty nature of our experience again and again, a transformation takes place. We see what is actually here. We see that we are not inherently angry or fearful, but we are inherently compassionate. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.4 Bringing It All Together View\" data-href=\"3.6.4 Bringing It All Together View\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-view.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.4 Bringing It All Together, Introduction - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.4 bringing it all together, introduction - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.4 Introduction"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introducing Bringing it All Together (2 min)","level":2,"id":"Introducing_Bringing_it_All_Together_(2_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-view.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-introduction.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476521,"modifiedTime":1759272588374,"sourceSize":2429,"sourcePath":"1.

It is just like with me, you know? I have many names: Mingyur Rinpoche, Karma Gyurme . . . They are different names that I received from different teachers, but I am one and the same person, right?&nbsp;\nNowadays, I have \"YMR.\" It is short for \"Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche.\" It is the same thing.\nAnother example is what we call \"a fire's flame.\" The flame is fire. It has heat, it has light, and it has color, but all of them are the same thing as fire. Awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom are the same thing, but as we are discovering them, they appear to be different. We discover awareness through awareness, through love and compassion, and through wisdom, but in the end, we know that all of them are the same. Then, awareness is love and compassion, love and compassion is wisdom, and wisdom is awareness. This is really wonderful. It is very important to try to recognize and be with that. Be with it as awareness, be with it as love and compassion, and be with it as wisdom.&nbsp;\nNow, please keep your spine loosely straight, and rest your mind in open awareness.\nWhen you rest your mind in open awareness, that is awareness, of course. And that is also love and compassion. Open awareness is unconditional love and compassion. It allows everything. It accepts everything.&nbsp;\nThere is also a feeling of love there. The moment you rest in open awareness, there is joy and there is love, although you cannot really describe it.&nbsp;\nAnd being with open awareness is wisdom. Recognizing open awareness is wisdom.\n[Silent meditation]&nbsp;\nNow, look for \"you\". You are awareness, you are love and compassion, and you are wisdom. You cannot find your body or your mind — both are empty. Yet they are not nothing. They manifest in your experience as you, a rainbowlike you, a dreamlike you. Or they appear as you, but you cannot describe this \"you.\"&nbsp;\nPossibly, there is a gap or an \"Aha!\" moment. You may experience the \"Aha!\" moment but not be able to describe it.&nbsp;\nThen, suddenly, a thought comes. That thought is also emptiness: \"Am I doing this right? Am I doing it wrong?\" That is also emptiness.\nIt is also love and compassion. It is also wisdom. Everything is a manifestation of awareness, love, and wisdom.\nAnxiety may come. Anxiety is emptiness. Stress in the body and mind can come. They are also emptiness. Then, you look around and see that all beings are emptiness, but they are not recognizing it. They have awareness, they have love, they have compassion, and they are free, but they do not know that they are free. They bind themselves.\nWhen you realize this, the sense of love and compassion for all beings manifests automatically.\nIn emptiness, nothing is wrong, and there are no mistakes.\nNow, just be with that. Be with emptiness. Rest with emptiness.\nOkay. 30 minutes&nbsp;of formal meditation every day\n210 minutes&nbsp;in total for this section\nA streak of&nbsp;7 days&nbsp;of practice\nMeditating with Bringing it All Together&nbsp;by Myoshin KelleyIn this practice, you will discover how awareness, compassion, and wisdom are ever-present and inseparable. You can cultivate the recognition of wisdom through awareness and compassion.\nBegin session Begin by finding your posture. As you allow your spine to be upright in a natural way and your body to be at ease and relaxed, touch into the emptiness of the body.&nbsp;\nTake a moment to form a compassionate motivation as a way of engaging your heart in the practice. Recite the opening aspiration or find your own language to give voice to this motivation.&nbsp;\nNext, rest in open awareness. Simply rest in this natural, knowing quality of your mind. Notice the sense of acceptance within awareness for any senses or perceptions that arise. Everything is a friend of awareness and an expression of loving-kindness and compassion. Knowing this is wisdom. Main practice First, look at the sense of self or the \"me.\" See how all the different aspects are empty, yet not nothing. The movement of loving-kindness is the wish to cultivate well-being, and compassion is the wish to be free from suffering. The play of these qualities is the expression of your fundamental nature. Seeing or being with this is wisdom.\nNow, as you connect with loving-kindness and compassion, reflect on all appearances as the union of emptiness and clarity. Rest in the emptiness or ungraspable nature of your mind.&nbsp;\nRemember, it is completely normal to get lost in thoughts or feelings. If you notice that you get distracted, you are already reconnected with awareness, loving-kindness and compassion, and wisdom.&nbsp;\nNext, bring to mind all beings. If you find it helpful to choose a particular person in your life, that is fine too. Reflect on the fact that, just like you, they too have experiences of confusion or grasping at appearances. And, just like you, they all share the potential to recognize their fundamental nature. As you feel the presence of all beings and see them in distress, recognize the qualities of loving-kindness and compassion that naturally come forth.\nNow, as you connect with loving-kindness and compassion, see if you can notice the empty nature of your experience. Just rest in emptiness, in the experience of recognizing the true nature of dream-like appearances. End session Let go of any reflections, and simply rest in open awareness.&nbsp;\nFinally, either using the closing dedication or finding your own language, dedicate any positivity that has come from this practice to the well-being of everyone. When you examine the sense of self, are you able to recognize that the qualities of awareness, loving-kindness and compassion, and wisdom are inseparable? Please explain what your experience is like.When you examine the sense of self, do you experience any reactions such as irritation, doubt, or fear around the practice? How do you practice with reactions like these?Inquiry\nCan you shift your perspective to transform adversities into reminders for your innate goodness?\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.4 Bringing It All Together Application\" data-href=\"3.6.4 Bringing It All Together Application\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-application.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.4 Bringing It All Together, Meditation - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.4 bringing it all together, meditation - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.4 Meditation"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Formal Meditation (25 min)","level":2,"id":"Formal_Meditation_(25_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Bringing it All Together Meditation</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Bringing_it_All_Together_Meditation*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Practice Requirements","level":3,"id":"Practice_Requirements_0"},{"heading":"Practice Instructions","level":3,"id":"Practice_Instructions_0"},{"heading":"Practice Journal","level":3,"id":"Practice_Journal_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 1","level":4,"id":"Reflection_1_0"},{"heading":"Reflection 2","level":4,"id":"Reflection_2_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-application.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-meditation.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476514,"modifiedTime":1759272588380,"sourceSize":7103,"sourcePath":"1.

It is not seeing by looking, but is emptiness. It is not a void, but is cognizant and clear. This inseparable awareness and emptiness is pervasive like space.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche\nIn this teaching, Mingyur Rinpoche discusses:\nthe two purposes of the Joy of Living training\nhow to recognize your fundamental nature\nthe perspective of modern science with regard to neuroplasticity\nWatch Read\nNow, this is the last set of teachings and practice. Everything is impermanent according to the relative level, so this course, too, is impermanent. But the teachings, the experience, awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom are all with you now.&nbsp;\nThese three levels have two purposes. The first is to discover who we are, to discover our innate goodness, our potential. Actually, we are more than what we believe we are, right? We have this amazing quality of awareness, and that awareness is always present and pure. It does not matter whether we are happy or not happy, whether we have thoughts, emotions, stress or no stress, panic or no panic. It does not matter. The background of all this is clarity. Awareness is always there.\nThen, together with that awareness, we have love and compassion. And that love and compassion infuses everything. The essence of all thoughts, emotions, feelings, perceptions, and even our automatic movements are infused by love and compassion. We simply have not been recognizing it, not discovering it, that is all. But it is actually there.\nNow here, in level three, we see everything as wisdom, don't we? In a way, the unhealthy sense of self is also a manifestation of the luminous self. The healthy sense of self is also a manifestation of the luminous self. Then, in the end, we come to the luminous self or self beyond self, the emptiness self, the ultimate reality, or the reality of ourselves. They all have the same meaning.\nSo, the first important purpose is to discover who we are, and the second is transformation. The special practice to discover that is what we call \"self-antidote,\" \"self-transformation,\" or \"self-liberation.\" We do not need to fight with anything, we do not need to create anything, and we do not have to get rid of anything.&nbsp;\nYou can see that from the first course up to here everything is based on being completely natural. By doing that, we will have more freedom, more happiness, and especially, we will become more flexible and pliable.&nbsp;\nNormally, we do not have a choice. Our mind is directed by the force of situations, the environment, objects, and our beliefs. So we have no choice.&nbsp;\nI met a scientist who said that the brain is capable of change and has what they call \"neuroplasticity,\" \"neuropathways,\" and \"neurogenesis,\" meaning that everything can be changed. Even if you are born unhappy, there is hope — you can change into a happy person.&nbsp;\nThe main problem normally is that we do not know how to change by ourselves. We have no control. We have no choice. We are under the control of the environment, situations, and subject and object. But now we have a choice, don't we? The choice comes from awareness, being with awareness, and recognizing awareness, love and compassion, and wisdom.&nbsp;\nI was a \"guinea pig\" and went to a lab, and they asked me, \"Please meditate for a few minutes on compassion. Now stop, and meditate on awareness. Now stop awareness.\"&nbsp;\nThere are gamma waves in the brain, and all of the different parts are synchronized, so that all of the parts of the brain work together. When I meditated, they all worked together, and when I stopped meditating, they stopped. So that is the result of meditation, that you can guide your own mind, you can lead your own mind. You can be free from the crazy monkey mind.\nWhat you have learned here in these three levels — all these teachings — comes from a 2500-year-old tradition, based on Buddhist meditation teachings. But these three levels have a secular basis, so everyone can practice them. You do not have to become a Buddhist.&nbsp;\nTraditionally, the teaching in level one is what we call&nbsp;shamatha, meaning \"concentration,\" \"samadhi,\" \"awareness,\" or \"one-pointedness.\" And then, in level two, we learn to practice metta, meaning \"love and compassion.\" In level three, we learn&nbsp;vipashyana, or \"insight meditation.\" But in some traditions, even level one becomes vipashyana meditation. This depends on the tradition, but in a way, in these three levels, we learn everything. So now, appreciate that, and bring everything together into your practice.\nQuestions for Understanding the View\nQuestion 1\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that one of the purposes of the Joy of Living Training is to discover our fundamental nature of awareness, loving-kindness and compassion, and wisdom. If your friend asked you what meditation is all about, what would you say? Question 2\nMingyur Rinpoche explains that the other purpose of the meditation practices in the Joy of Living Training is to transform everything into an opportunity to recognize your true nature. What does \"self-antidote\" or \"self-liberation\" mean in this context? Points to remember:\nYou discover the fundamental nature of who you are through meditation training.&nbsp;\nYou can transform everything by seeing it as an expression of your innate goodness; the process is called \"self-antidote,\" \"self-liberation,\" or \"self-transformation.\"\nBelow the surface of suffering is awareness, loving-kindness and compassion, and wisdom.&nbsp;\nThe Sanskrit terms&nbsp;shamatha, metta, karuna,&nbsp;and&nbsp;vipashyana&nbsp;correspond respectively to the awareness, loving-kindness, compassion, and wisdom practices in the Joy of Living Training.\nTip\nYou don't meditate to improve yourself, you meditate to see that you are already as perfect as you could ever hope to be.\nIn this reading, you will learn:\nthe benefits of recognizing emptiness\nabout how to avoid problems in dreams\nthe characteristics of our true nature The Joy of Living, pp. 240–243 (Ch. 17:&nbsp;\"The Benefits of Recognizing Emptiness\")\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"3.6.4 Bringing It All Together Meditation\" data-href=\"3.6.4 Bringing It All Together Meditation\" href=\"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-meditation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Next →</a>","aliases":["3.6.4 Bringing It All Together, View - Tergar Joy Of Living Course","3.6.4 bringing it all together, view - Tergar joy of living course","3.6.4 View"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#topic/meditation/tergar/JOL"],"headers":[{"heading":"Teaching (15 min)","level":2,"id":"Teaching_(15_min)_0"},{"heading":"<em>Bringing it All Together: View</em> by Mingyur Rinpoche","level":3,"id":"*Bringing_it_All_Together_View*_by_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Reading (6 min)","level":2,"id":"Reading_(6_min)_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"1.-jol/level-3/3.6/3.6.4-bringing-it-all-together-view.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476499,"modifiedTime":1759272588394,"sourceSize":6879,"sourcePath":"1.

Feel free to experiment and find the approach that works best for you.)\nThe first step is to try to see the freedoms and opportunities that you already have in your own life. Appreciate the fact that you are alive and have this human body together with the senses. Appreciate that you have eyes to see with, ears to hear with, a tongue that makes it possible for you to taste food and drink, a nose that you can smell fragrances with, and that you are able to touch and feel tactile sensations. Appreciate that you can breathe and move around. Most of the time, we take these basic attributes for granted and do not appreciate them. The practice here is to appreciate what you already have and recognize these wonderful qualities. Reflect on these different attributes one-by-one.\nStep two is to appreciate everything good that has happened and is happening in your life. Appreciate that you have friends, family, a wonderful teacher, a profound practice, and a supportive spiritual community. You have human intelligence, knowledge, love, compassion, wisdom, and other skills and talents.\nStep three is to exchange your own situation with that of other beings in different places and realms. Try to see that what you take for granted is extremely rare in other places. An animal, for example, does not have the same mental capacity and opportunity to practice the dharma.\nThroughout this reflection, alternate periods of contemplation with periods of resting in awareness.\n(In any given practice session, you can focus on one of these steps, or you can alternate between steps. Feel free to experiment and find the approach that works best for you.)\nStep one is to reflect on the subtle momentary impermanence of your own body. Notice the change that happens with each breath. You breathe in and the previous moment is gone. You breathe out and everything has changed. Nothing stays the same, even for a moment. Every heartbeat indicates change. Every time your heart beats, the whole universe has changed. Notice all of these changes as you alternate periods of contemplation and resting in awareness.\nStep two is to contemplate the more obvious level of impermanence. Reflect upon something that has happened in the past. It might have been something good or something bad. If it was something bad that happened, look at the result that came out of that. The event may have been painful and you suffered, but perhaps a good result came out of it. On the other hand, if there was something positive that happened, it might now be gone or it might have turned into an unfortunate circumstance. It is very important to see that your life goes up and down and that life is very colorful for that exact reason. Alternate this contemplation with resting in awareness.\nStep three is to contemplate that you are getting older and eventually will die. Try to see that moment-by-moment, second-by-second, you are getting older. Recognize the fleeting nature of this life and resolve to make the most of the time you have. Contemplate how you can focus on what is truly meaningful and of lasting benefit.\nAlternate this contemplation with periods of resting in awareness.\n(In any given practice session, you can focus on one of these steps, or you can alternate between steps. Feel free to experiment and find the approach that works best for you.)\nStep one is to contemplate interdependence. Begin by reflecting on how everything — the universe, the environment, your behavior, and your mind — is related. Our inner experience is shaped by what happens around us and what happens in our own body and mind. Contemplate this and alternate with periods of resting in awareness.\nStep two is to try to go deeper into interdependence. Take a specific aspect of your experience — such as the body, an emotion, or any other experience — and notice how it consists of many different elements. Notice all the different causes and conditions that have come together for it to occur. In recognizing that everything we experience consists of many different parts and is the result of many causes and conditions, notice how things are not nearly as solid and real as they often appear. Alternate this investigation with periods of resting in awareness.\nStep three is to contemplate how this understanding relates to your behavior and actions. As your understanding of karma and interdependence deepens, you will see that your future experience is shaped by what you do in the present. Consider your own actions and empower yourself by knowing that you are in charge over your future situation.\nRest in awareness from time to time, alternating contemplation with periods of resting in awareness.\n(In any given practice session, you can focus on one of these steps, or you can alternate between steps. Feel free to experiment and find the approach that works best for you.)\nStep one is to contemplate the suffering of suffering. Begin by contemplating all the inevitable things that we try to avoid. We want to stay healthy and young, and we do not want to die, but all of these will eventually happen. Reflect on how you cannot avoid these things and how they are a source of suffering. From time to time, rest in awareness before continuing your contemplation.\nStep two is to contemplate the suffering of change. Think of a situation or a person that makes you happy. Try to see how this feeling of happiness comes with strong expectations and grasping. Notice how we want things to remain the way they are now or expect them to turn out a particular way. Since everything changes, these expectations and attachments to the situation or person will lead you to experience the suffering of change. Contemplate this as you rest in awareness from time to time.\nStep three is to contemplate pervasive suffering. Reflect on everything that you have that makes you happy: your job, house, partner, etc. Although you have all these things, if you look deeply, is there still a feeling that things could be better, that your life is still incomplete? Alternate this contemplation with resting in awareness.\nStep four is to develop renunciation. Recognizing that everything changes and that our expectations rarely match what actually happens, consider that no matter where you look for happiness within samsara, there is no lasting happiness to be found. As your understanding of the suffering of samsara deepens, try to connect with this feeling of wanting to be free of samsara and to achieve lasting happiness by discovering your own true nature.\nStep five is to develop love and compassion. Understand from your own feelings of wanting to be free of suffering and to achieve happiness, that this is also true for others, for all sentient beings. Make the wish that everyone be free of suffering and the causes of suffering, and that they achieve happiness and the causes of happiness. You may recite silently, \"May you be happy and have the causes of happiness,\" and \"May you be free of suffering and the causes of suffering.\"\nAlternate this contemplation with periods of resting in awareness.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Precious Human Life","level":2,"id":"Precious_Human_Life_0"},{"heading":"Impermanence","level":2,"id":"Impermanence_0"},{"heading":"Karma","level":2,"id":"Karma_0"},{"heading":"Suffering of Samsara","level":2,"id":"Suffering_of_Samsara_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2.-pol/level-1/instructions-for-contemplating-the-four-thoughts.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476000,"modifiedTime":1758235982887,"sourceSize":7564,"sourcePath":"2.

Feel free to experiment and find the approach that works best for you.)\nIn this level, the first half of the nature of mind instructions pertain to the exploration of stillness, movement, and awareness.\nFor this practice, rest naturally without trying to control experience in any way, yet without being lost in distraction. When it comes to your state of mind, there are only two options: the mind is either still or it is moving. At times, the mind may be calm, with few thoughts and emotions or little movement of attention toward sense objects. At other times, it may be very active — thinking, feeling, and perceiving.\nThe first step in this practice is to notice when the mind is still and when it is moving. You do not have to create or hold on to periods of stillness, or to stop the mind from being active by controlling thoughts and emotions, or directing your attention. The practice here is to rest in awareness no matter what state the mind is in — even if it is dull, restless, or confused. As long as you know that you are calm and peaceful, that you are restless and agitated, or that you are dull or confused, that is enough. Simply rest in awareness no matter what happens.\nThe second step is to look at the nature of stillness and movement. Is the nature of stillness the same or different from the nature of movement? At this point, you can ask this question and directly observe your experience of stillness and movement. This is not a thought exercise. When the mind is still, what is the very nature of that stillness? Does it have a location? A shape or color? Does it have boundaries? When you explore the experience of stillness, what do you find? Do the same with the experience of movement and see if the nature of stillness and movement is the same or different.\nFor the third step, turn your attention to awareness itself — to the one who is experiencing these expressions of stillness and movement. Is the knower of stillness the same or different from the knower of movement? Who or what is it that knows this stillness? What is it that experiences the mind's activity? Again, the point here is to explore your experience from within, not to answer with the conceptual mind.\nThroughout this exploration, the main practice is still to rest in awareness. You can intersperse periods of resting in awareness with a brief inquiry. For instance, you might begin by resting in awareness and noticing whether the mind is still or active. You could then gently inquire into the nature of the experience for a few moments, and then again rest in awareness. After another short period of resting in awareness, you might then observe the knower, or experiencer, of movement or stillness for a few moments. Then relax and rest in awareness once again. In this way, you can alternate brief, gentle periods of inquiry with periods of resting naturally in awareness.\nEnd your nature of mind practice by resting in awareness.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2.-pol/level-1/instructions-for-meditating-on-stillness-movement-and-awareness.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476000,"modifiedTime":1758235985029,"sourceSize":3083,"sourcePath":"2.

Whatever phenomena come, whatever you think about, like pizza, or maybe something related with a visual object, sound, smell, taste, sensation, or whatever — these are movement. And in between those, there might be a gap, when the mind is just resting, in a nonconceptual state, or very quiet.\nOf course, there is no absolute gap — that is impossible. There is always something there, but not on the gross level. You feel like mind is just resting. So resting is stillness, and engaging with perception, thought, emotion, and feeling is movement. You can use your hands in this practice as a support for awareness and for recognizing movement and stillness. When there is movement, raise one hand a little bit. If there is not much movement, let it down. Or you can alternate raising your right and left hands for movement and stillness, respectively. There is no need to raise your hand high. Just keep it on your knee.\nNormally, we like stillness and do not like movement, but now it does not matter which occurs. It does not matter whether your mind is resting or if there is thought, emotion, form, sound, smell, etc. What is important is awareness, watching. Here, \"awareness\" means the observer. That is important.\n(You can intersperse the following steps with open awareness meditation, as often as you would like or as feels natural. In any given practice session, you can focus on one of these steps, or you can alternate between steps. Feel free to experiment and find the approach that works best for you.)\nStep one: First, rest your mind in open awareness meditation for a little bit. Begin to watch whatever phenomena arise in your mind. Form, sound, smell, taste, sensation, thought, emotion&nbsp;— whatever phenomenon comes up for you, just be with it. For a few minutes, continue to observe any thought, emotion, or other phenomenon or perception that appears. Sometimes these phenomena disappear as soon as you look at them. There is a gap. That is what we call \"stillness.\" You cannot really grab it. If you experience a gap, just rest with that until the mind naturally turns toward outward phenomena again. There is no need to try to stay with the gap. Continue to watch the movement and stillness of the mind. It doesn’t matter whether your mind is resting — perhaps with an experience of nonconceptuality, peace, or nonduality — or if there is thought, emotion, form, sound, smell, etc. What is important is simply to be aware.\nStep two: Now, begin to look at the difference between the movement and stillness of the mind. What is the difference between them? Are they different like fire and water, or like eastern mountains and western mountains? Or are they like the ocean and waves? When the ocean makes a wave, the essence of the wave is still the ocean. When the wave dissolves, it is still the ocean. Continue to gently observe the difference between stillness and movement. When you continue observing like this, you might see that, for the mind, there is not really a difference between stillness and movement. Both are awareness; both are consciousness; both are knowingness. Both are clarity or luminosity. Here, “luminosity” means “knowing.” You are not unconscious. The mind has a special capacity for knowing, experiencing, or cognizing — that is luminosity. Movement is luminosity, and stillness is also luminosity. So at a certain level, it does not matter which one comes. Just be with whatever arises, as it is.\nStep three: Now, step three is to look at the observer. The observer is like the ocean, and stillness and movement are like the waves. When the waves come up, it is movement. When they come down, it is stillness. No matter what you experience, just be with the knower, the knowing quality. What is the nature of the waves? It is the ocean itself. Whatever arises in the mind, its essence is still awareness, the ocean. So just be with awareness. The mind is also like the sky. Having many clouds and storms is movement, and having fewer clouds or not many clouds is stillness. What is the basis of these clouds? It is the sky, or space. Be with the sky. Here, you do not need to ask questions. Just be with the knower. Maybe the observer feels like a sense of \"me.\" Here, there is no need to look at the sense of \"me.\" You are not looking at thought, emotion, subject, or object. You are looking at mind — the knower. If the \"me\" comes, let it come and let it go, but look at the \"me\"-er. There is no need to look too much, or to ask many questions. Just be with that a little bit . . . and rest.\nEnd your nature of mind practice by resting in awareness.\n(Practice each of these steps in succession, making each the focal point of your nature of mind practice for a number of sessions before moving on to the next set of instructions)\nThe second half of the nature of mind instructions pertain to the exploration of the first pointing out instruction that all phenomena come from mind.\nFor this practice, rest naturally without trying to control experience in any way, yet without being lost in distraction. This practice has two main components: analytical meditation (step 1–5) and resting meditation (step 6.)\nThe first step is for the mind to look inward. Let the mind turn inward and look for the \"Self\" or \"I.\" We think of our body, speech, and mind — all together — as \"me.\" Ask yourself, \"What is my body? \"What is my speech? What is my mind?\" Observe your experience and see what you find. Alternate this inquiry with resting in awareness from time to time.\nStep two is to ask yourself, \"Of my body, speech, and mind, which is the most important and shapes my experience the most? Which one is the boss? Does the body control the speech and mind? Does speech control the body and mind? Or does the mind control the body and speech?\"\nStep three is to reflect on how the mind shapes our day-to-day experience. For example, you could recall an experience of being outside on a hot day and the aversion you felt, and compare this to enjoying being in a sauna or steam bath. Think of examples like this from your own life that indicate how the mind shapes our experience and informs how we relate to external circumstances.\nStep four is to contemplate how samsara is perpetuated by the mind. Out of ignorance, the kleshas (anger, attachment, pride, jealousy etc.) are produced. These lead us to engage in negative actions that create negative karma, which in turn results in samsara, the cycle of suffering and dissatisfaction. Contemplate how all of samsara begins with the mind and is perpetuated by the ignorance of not recognizing our true nature and instead seeing things in a distorted way.\nStep five is to consider how all phenomena are created by the mind. Look at an object and imagine breaking it down further and further. Do you reach a point where you cannot break these parts, or particles, down any further? If you think you have found the smallest particle that constitutes the object, ask yourself, \"Does this particle have sides or not?\" If the answer is \"Yes, the particle has sides,\" the consequence of that answer is that the object can be broken down further, because something that has sides can always be broken down further. If the answer is \"No, the particle does not have sides,\" the consequence is that the object in front of you could not be there, because something that does not have sides cannot connect with other particles to build something bigger. Particles with no sides would simply merge with one another. Continue to investigate in this way, and try to recognize how the apparent solidity of things is illusory, like a mirage or a dream. Notice how everything that appears is empty and not true or real in the way that it appears. You can also contemplate how periods of time can be broken down, or how everything we experience in our dreams appear to be real, but are creations of the mind. As you contemplate these topics, pause from time to time and rest in awareness.\nStep six is connected with resting meditation. Begin by turning the mind inward and be aware of the feeling of \"me.\" At this point, you do not have to ask any questions or contemplate; just be aware of the feeling of \"me\" or \"self.\" Where is this \"me\" located? What is it like? As you try to do this, you might find that you cannot really pinpoint this so-called \"me.\" Simply notice what happens when you observe the feeling of being a self. You can also observe other experiences. Look at an object in front of you, for instance. Are you experiencing the object as it truly is? Is it \"out there\" just as it appears, or is it a projection of your mind? Notice how everything you experience is like a dream: there is nothing there, yet it appears. Simply recognize this and then let go and rest within this knowing.\nThroughout this exploration, the main practice is still to rest in awareness. You can intersperse periods of resting in awareness with a brief inquiry. For instance, you might begin by resting in awareness and then gently observe your experience of body, speech, and mind for a few moments, and then rest again in awareness. In this way, you can alternate brief, gentle periods of inquiry with periods of resting naturally in awareness.\nEnd your nature of mind practice by resting in awareness.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Fresh Instructions from Mingyur Rinpoche","level":2,"id":"Fresh_Instructions_from_Mingyur_Rinpoche_0"},{"heading":"Previous Instructions","level":2,"id":"Previous_Instructions_0"}],"links":["1.-jol/level-1/1.3/1.3.1-transforming-thoughts-meditation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2.-pol/level-1/instructions-on-pointing-out-that-all-phenomena-come-from-mind.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750800476000,"modifiedTime":1759272588410,"sourceSize":9662,"sourcePath":"2.

Begin by resting your mind as it is. Next, let your mind face outward. After a few seconds, turn the mind inward — mind looking at mind. Then ask the following questions: \"Where is the mind? What does the mind look like? Does it have any color, shape, or form? Does the mind have a beginning or end? Is it inside or outside the body?\" Ask each of these questions one by one, and take time to observe your experience, and see what you find. Do not think about these questions intellectually. Observe your mind directly. Alternate this inquiry with resting in awareness from time to time.\nWhen you investigate the mind, you will see that you cannot find it. The mind is open and empty, just like space. It has no shape, no form, no color, no beginning, no end, no outside, and no inside. It is completely empty. Yet, something knows it is empty. That knowing is the clarity. Awareness is still present. Your mind is the union of emptiness and clarity; you cannot find it when you look for it, yet it is not nothing because you still know and experience things. When you experience this \"unfindability\" of the mind, let go and rest in awareness. Step two is the practice of mind looking at mind. Begin by resting your mind as it is for a few moments. Next, let the mind face out. After a few seconds, turn the mind inward, and let the mind look at itself. You do not have to ask any questions here, but simply let the mind look at the mind, and then rest. There is nothing to see, nothing to pinpoint. It is all empty. While being empty, you can still see and hear. Also, you know it is empty. This is the clarity. The union of emptiness and clarity is right here. You do not need to investigate for this step, simply look within, and then rest.\nThroughout this exploration, the main practice is still to rest in awareness. You can intersperse periods of resting in awareness with a brief inquiry. For instance, you might begin by resting in awareness and then gently examine the mind's shape or boundaries for a few moments, and then rest again in awareness. In this way, you can alternate brief, gentle periods of inquiry with periods of resting naturally in awareness.\nEnd your nature of mind practice by resting in awareness.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2.-pol/level-2/instructions-for-meditating-on-mind-is-emptiness.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752855137000,"modifiedTime":1758235965997,"sourceSize":2680,"sourcePath":"2.

All of these elements should be included in each practice session, but you can choose to spend more time on a specific element in a particular session if you find it helpful for your practice.)\nThe first step is to reflect upon your motivation for taking refuge. Think to yourself, \"I want to take refuge not only to benefit myself, but also to benefit my friends, family, and all sentient beings. I am going to practice refuge to become a buddha in order to help all sentient beings become buddhas.\"\nStep two is to try to imagine the refuge tree and the sources of refuge. Begin by imagining that you are in a beautiful environment surrounded by trees, lowers, birds, green fields, etc. Within this atmosphere, imagine a pristine, clear, blue lake. From the middle of this lake grows a wish-fulfilling tree, consisting of a trunk and four branches, one in each direction. Imagine that in the middle of the wish-fulfilling tree is a lotus lower. Upon the lotus lower sits <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/bh8uqa7ti4ql2992dp985/Buddha-Shakyamuni.jpeg?rlkey=3e1r9c06sp3zt07urod3dzry1&amp;st=ylw6gfo3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/bh8uqa7ti4ql2992dp985/Buddha-Shakyamuni.jpeg?rlkey=3e1r9c06sp3zt07urod3dzry1&amp;st=ylw6gfo3\" target=\"_self\">Buddha Shakyamuni</a>, who looks upon you with great affection, smiling. His right hand covers his right knee and touches the ground. His left hand holds a bowl. Imagine the Buddha as though he is a mirage or like a reflection of the moon in a lake, as an empty appearance that is not solid or real. You can also think of Buddha Shakyamuni as representing all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and your own teachers. The most important part of this practice is to feel the presence of the Buddha, who embodies your gurus and and the buddhas throughout the three times, so don't worry if you cannot maintain a clear visual image.\nStep three is to reflect on the enlightened qualities of your guru, who is inseparable from the Buddha. Begin by bringing about a strong feeling of the Buddha being present in front of you. Reflect on all the enlightened qualities of the Buddha, such as wisdom, compassion, and loving-kindness. Imagine that you can actually feel these enlightened qualities radiating from the Buddha. You are taking refuge in the Buddha’s wisdom and compassion. As you reflect upon these qualities, rest in awareness from time to time.\n<br>Step four is to reflect upon the meaning of refuge while reciting the three-line refuge prayer and doing prostrations. Begin by getting up from your seat and place your hands in anjali at your heart-center. As you recite \"Namo Buddhaya, Namo Dharmaya, Namo Sanghaya,\" bring your hands to the forehead, throat, and heart-center, and then perform a prostration. As you recite the refuge verses, continue this sequence.<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-0a7c5632817b702f\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> While doing prostrations with your body and reciting the refuge prayer with your speech, reflect upon the meaning of taking refuge with your mind. The meaning of taking refuge is acceptance. You accept the Buddha as your guide and teacher, the Dharma as your path and practice, and the Sangha as your friends and companions on the path.\nStep five is to contemplate the inner refuge. Begin by chanting the last line of the liturgy, beginning with, \"The ultimate refuge is perfectly complete within me.\" Next, connect with the buddha nature within yourself by imagining that the Buddha melts into light and that this light dissolves into you. Imagine that your mind and the enlightened awareness of the Buddha merge inseparably, like water poured into water. Following this, simply rest within awareness itself. From time to time, remind yourself that your buddha nature is not different from the awakened nature of all the buddhas. Then simply rest in awareness once again. <br>The number of prostrations or recitations you do depends on how much time you have. At a minimum, offer three in each session, though you may perform seven, twenty-one, or one hundred and eight, or more.<a href=\"#fnref-1-0a7c5632817b702f\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"2.-pol/level-2/instructions-for-practicing-refuge.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752854067000,"modifiedTime":1758235968545,"sourceSize":3970,"sourcePath":"2.

We have this habit, the habit of not doing retreat, and when you do retreat, this is something new and a big change for you. To build up this new habit is not so easy. Say you are doing four sessions per day, it is not so easy.In the beginning, you might have a lot of enthusiasm, but after some time you will lose it. Then, when you do retreat you suddenly go off track, you grab your phone, read books, and maybe nowadays surfing on your phone or watch television. In the ancient times, they were painting thangkas or making clothes. So these things easily come in retreat, it is an easy mistake to make. Therefore, you need to stay with a structure. If the sessions are too long, you have to make them shorter and do more of them.There are other mistakes like being attached to meditation experiences. When you do retreat, your meditation experience becomes better and better. You will have more clarity and bliss, feeling blissful, peaceful, and joyful — all of these things — and experience a non-conceptual state of mind. You might feel like, \"OK. Now I have achieved a high level of realization.\" or you think, \"From now on, I will have no problems with negative emotions or monkey mind (or whatever you want to call it). I am completely free and liberated.\" These are attachments. You might be stuck in these meditation experiences, being attached to these meditation experiences. This is another easy mistake to make.Sometimes, you even know that you should not get attached to the meditation experience, but you cannot really help it. It is not so easy. That is OK. One important thing is to make room for mistakes. When you do retreat, you will not meditate in the four sessions from beginning to end, it is impossible. A lot of things will happen: you will get lost, the quality will not be good, after some time you will not know what you are doing, and then the waterfall experience with these negative emotions comes.When I was young and did retreat I one time did a retreat here — now I am in Osel Ling monastery — I wanted to do retreat for one week in Osel Ling monastery and at that time my father was in the Ka Nying monastery, near the big stupa in Nepal, in the Eastern part of Kathmandu, and I was here in the Western part of Kathmandu. So, I was with my father in the Eastern part of Kathmandu, and I told my father that I was going to do retreat for one week and I came here to Osel Ling monastery. In the beginning, my meditation experience was so wonderful. I was very clear, I was so happy and joyful, and I felt like, \"Finally! I am in the right place, with the right circumstances, under the right situation.\" everything was just right. Then, on day three this bliss, joy, and whatever else felt right was completely gone, the wonderful experiences that I expected were completely gone. Then my mind became very dry and I could not get a taste of meditation. It became dry and I did not know what I was doing. My mind became foggy and as soon as I started my meditation sessions it became like this (Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to fall asleep). That one was quite bad so when I had finished the one week I felt so happy (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs). So that retreat did not go very well.Some days your retreat might not go so well either. Even if your retreat does not go so well, try your best, and it is OK to fail. Failing is the mother of success. Whatever we do, in the beginning, we might fail. When you look at very successful people, they are the ones that fail the most in the beginning. They fail more because they try more. \"This does not work. That does not work. Here it does not work.\" but in the end, when one thing works well, they become very successful. It is the same thing with retreat.Do not be attached to meditation experiences. Do not expect your retreat to be wonderful and fantastic. Try to stay with a structure without mixing it up too much, but within the meditation sessions, you can change (method) from time to time. That is OK. No problem.These are all easy mistakes to do on retreat, and many people do make these kinds of mistakes, and after that, they feel discouraged. Some of this is normal, it is part of the waterfall experience. If you do retreat, sometimes it might be like that. Instead of being discouraged, you have to appreciate it, \"Wow! Now my mind has become crazier than before and I think more than before. How nice! My mind has become very dull. How nice!\" You can appreciate it the other way around. Then it will give you a lot of inspiration and the next retreat will be better.","aliases":["Common Pitfalls In Retreat","common pitfalls in retreat"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/common-pitfalls-in-retreat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250361485,"sourceSize":4921,"sourcePath":"3.

Some people, when they meditate in a very tight way or do meditation intensively, afterward the energy movement comes. Some people, because of what we call, \"Prana, bindu, nadi,\" in the body; prana, bindu, nadi means the channels, energy, and the cells in the body. You have energy movement. Normally, 10% of the people have this energy movement.What is energy movement? Energy movement is, actually, when you meditate your body is transforming. Your cells, energy in the body, everything is transforming. It is transforming from negative to positive, and from positive to wisdom. The transformation from positive to wisdom only comes after the direct realization of your true nature, the nature of mind. But, the normal transformation from impure to pure comes with any meditation technique. If you do any meditation that is related to awareness, it will transform. For some people, in the transition of this transformation, they will have this energy movement.Energy movement has four things: first is the five sensory perceptions, the second is a special sense in the mind, the third is emotions going up and down, and the fourth is physical body sensations, these are the four thingsMaybe I will tell you about the last one, the fourth, about physical sensations. Some people feel warmth or heat on the top of their head. They feel like something is moving or opening here, and sometimes there are some kind of energy that moves at the center of your head. For some people, there is a sense of tingling from the bottom of the spine moving upward, like an electric movement. Like a sensation of tingling or electrical movement. Some people feel heat around their stomach. They feel warmth and heat coming from the stomach. Some people feel a pressure in the forehead, throat, and heart-center. They feel some pressure or heat or something like that. Some people even have movements taking place inside of their bodies. It is kind of like a vibration inside the body that is shaking. Some people feel like the energy comes and shoots to the top of their head. Sometimes it feels like the energy comes and then get stuck in the throat, heart-center, or the forehead, it cannot flow. Sometimes you want to cry, without a reason. Just tears are coming. Sometimes, if people have very strong energy movements, they do different mudras, dance, shake, or something like that. These are the energy movements related to physical signs.Then we have the five sensory perceptions. What are the five sensory perceptions? The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, etc. From the eyes, you can sometimes see colors, sparks, and bindus. Or some people they see visions — visions of enlightened beings, visions of their teacher, or sometimes visions of ghosts, demons, and maras. They see good, bad, and neutral things.Next is sound. You hear a particular sound that nobody else around hears. Your friends do not hear it but you do. People around you do not hear the sound but you hear it. Sometimes, that sound could be a mantra, or it could be a teaching, an enlightened being or a buddha teaching you, your teacher giving you special messages, or sometimes there are messages coming from demons or ghosts, it looks like someone is spying on you, watching you, telling you things, like a guide. It could be something like that.Next is smell. You smell something which your friends cannot smell. Not so many people have this taste and smell thing.Sometimes it is almost like you feel something tactile. It feels like there is a presence of someone, maybe an enlightened being or demon nearby, and it is almost like you feel that person and you almost see and hear it sometimes.Sometimes the five sensory perceptions come together. That is also possible. These are the five sensory perceptionsThe next is this special sense. One has a sense of energy. \"This place has positive energy. This place has negative energy. This person has positive energy. I am receiving positive energy from this person. I am receiving negative energy from that person. Oh. I am receiving positive energy from my teacher. My teacher is there with me, right next to me. I have a special connection with my teacher. We are communicating in different ways. Today my teacher came and talked to me.\" or something like that. It is like one can sense it, almost. Maybe you do not see it, but you sense it. Sometimes you can see it, but you do not sense it. Sometimes both of these are together. It also depends on the personality having this sense of energy. In some places you can sense good energy, in other places, there is bad energy. All of this belongs to the sense of energy.The last one is that one's emotions go up and down. Sometimes you feel blissful, joyful, and clear. You are so happy and then you enter a special state of mind and then suddenly this happiness or joyful experience is completely gone. You can also have a lot of anger, or sometimes strong desire, anxiety, or different kind of emotions that come. So, the emotions go up and down.These are the four things. Among these four things, two are real and two are not real. What are the real ones? The physical signs, like feeling heat here (Mingyur Rinpoche points to the top of his head) or it feels like there is an opening, with this there is something really happening in your body, so that one is real. The second one is when the emotions are going up and down. Having emotional ups and downs is real because you have emotions and you are feeling emotions. But two things are not real. This five sensory perception is not real. Seeing a buddha or a demon, hearing wonderful enlightened messages or hearing bad messages from demons or maras are not real. Do not get attached to this. The same goes for smells, tastes, and all these things. The sense of energy is also not real. Whatever you are feeling, if you are receiving bad energy or receiving good energy is not real.Now, what do you have to do? You have to view it as watching television — watching 3D television. When you go to a big cinema and watches 3D you wear glasses, right? And you see everything as real and there are sounds and smells and all these things. So, treat these experiences similar to watching television. Do not believe in these things. Some people do not know that this is energy movement and they get attached to those messages. When you receive positive visions and messages you think, \"Aha! I am enlightened. Finally, something is happening with me. Ha! I have visions of these teachers and buddhas and now I am receiving teachings every day, and the message says, 'You are the most important person in this world! You came to this world to benefit others.'\" Do not believe in these things. Do not be attached to that.Sometimes these messages turn into rough or bad things, like ghosts harming you, \"Oh! You will have big obstacles next time.\" It is like someone is watching and spying on you and giving you obstacles and bad energies, or something like that. This is also not real. Do not be attached to that. Do not think that you are special and do not think that you are crazy. Some people think, \"I have become crazy.\" and some people think, \"I am enlightened.\"\nYou are not enlighted.\nYou are not crazy.\nIt is just energy movement.\nDo not be attached to that. Treat it just like you are watching television, do physical exercise sometimes, this is really important, and drink a lot of water. And if you know that this is energy movement, and you know that this is not real but these images, voices, or energy movements still come — it will not disappear right away — but every time you tell yourself, \"This is just energy movement. I am not crazy. I am not enlightened. It is just energy movement.\" Energy movement is not bad, actually. It is the sign of something, the sign of transformation. But if you get attached to it, if you think it is real, then that is the problem.If you move too much sometimes, let us say that you put both of your hands together and put on the top of your head, it helps sometimes. Also, do not meditate too long. You have to break it up — short times many times, short times many times. Sometimes, you can meditate while standing up or while walking. Do walking and standing meditation. These are very good. If you do not know about energy movement and you have been attached to energy movements for a long time, and you cannot get away from the energy movements, then maybe do not meditate for one month of half a month. Stop meditating and do some physical exercise. Then you can again begin to meditate a little bit, short times, many times. Then it will be fineThis is very important to know. Many people are confused about this, and they do not know that this is energy movement. It is very important to recognize this energy movement and to not be attached to these experiences.","aliases":["Energy Movement","energy movement"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/energy-movement.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250365781,"sourceSize":9233,"sourcePath":"3.

The best is to find balance between retreat and daily practice — then they will really support each other.\nIn the beginning, it is very important to do short, high quality retreats.\nYou can use the same schedule for retreats of different lengths.\nStick to the meditation structure, within that structure, change the meditation methods.\nAlternating meditation methods supports the methods themselves.\nKeep the sessions in retreat between 1-3 hours each.\nIf you do retreat at home, create a supportive environment.\nEvery month, try to do one weekend retreat.\nDoing retreat is a very precious and valuable thing to do in the world.\nRetreat is not an escape, but rather a way to benefit others. The waterfall experience is a good sign that your meditation is progressing.\nThe waterfall experience will make it look like your negative emotions increase, but suddenly it will change, you will feel very happy — this is a good sign.\nMeditation experience going up and down are both good: Down experiences are good for realization\nUp experiences are good for inspiration The signs of meditation are: Equanimity and inner peace\nAwareness\nKindness and Compassion\nWisdom Since meditation experience goes up and down, do not look for improvements day-by-day but focus on the long-term.\nRealization develops little by little, so you cannot track it day-by-day.\nA warning sign is becoming attached to experiences; they then turn into a boost for your ego.\nIf the ego becomes stronger and you become more arrogant, that means you are off track.\nExperience always changes, but realization is enduring.\nAppreciate even tiny transformations that take place in retreat.\nLet go of expectations, focus on the motivation, and do not give up.\nExample: Cow Dung on the Wall\nIn India, people often dry cow dung on the walls of their home and use the dried cow dung for cooking fires. This is used as an example for the waterfall experience. When the cow dung has dried it does not look so bad and it does not smell much. But if you put water onto it in an effort to clean it off the wall, it becomes very dirty and smells really bad. Similarly, we may not notice our thoughts and emotions as much when we are not paying attention, but when we begin to meditate we begin to see them more clearly.Example: Fish in a Muddy River\nIf a river becomes muddy, you cannot see the fish in the river. But when the river becomes clean and pure again, you can see the fish in the river. This does not mean that the river gets more fish, you are simply just able to see them because the water is clean. Similarly, before practicing meditation you were one with your thoughts and emotions and therefore could not see them. Now, however, you begin to recognize your thoughts and emotions and can see them because your mind has become more calm and peaceful.Example: Traveling from Eastern to Central Tibet\nIn old Tibet, if you wanted to travel from eastern Tibet to central Tibet you had to walk through the mountains. Whether you were going up or down the mountain, you were continuously getting closer to your destination. Similarly, for a meditator, experience goes up and down and both the ups and downs of experience bring you closer to the goal.","aliases":["How To Practice In Retreat, Summary Of Key Points","how to practice in retreat, summary of key points","summary of the key points"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Introduction","level":2,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Setting Up a Retreat","level":2,"id":"Setting_Up_a_Retreat_0"},{"heading":"The Mind &amp; Retreat","level":2,"id":"The_Mind_&_Retreat_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/how-to-practice-in-retreat-summary-of-key-points.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250369858,"sourceSize":4316,"sourcePath":"3.

Milarepa said:Quote\nThe most important thing is our mind. For a mind that is really focused on meditation and focused on the dharma, the outside circumstances do not matter much.\n— Milarepa\nMilarepa said that there are four possibilities: (1) Doing retreat in the mountains, but the mind is in the city. So, your mind is busy and involved in aversion and attachment and all these things, but the body is in the mountains; (2) the body is in the city or town but the mind is in the mountains; (3) both together — the body is in the mountains and the mind is in the mountains; (4) neither — both the body and the mind are not in the mountains. These are the four possibilities.One possibility is that the body is in the city, but the mind is in the mountains. What is the meaning of the mind being in the mountains? The meaning is that you are practicing meditation in everyday life. Sometimes we call this, \"Enlightened without cutting the hair.\" The meaning is that you do not have to become a monk or nun, and you do not have to go to a cave. You do everything, just like in a normal life, but you need to practice.How to practice in the beginning? You have to practice short times many times, little by little. You need to change your habits, in the beginning. When it comes to changing habits, we cannot change huge habits, right away. If a train goes forward very fast and you would like to change the direction, first, you need to slow down, right? You need to slow down and you change little by little. You cannot change right away, like this (Mingyur Rinpoche turns his hand 180 degrees.) You change little by little, and then you can change the whole habit. It is similar to that.We have very strong habits from everyday life, the monkey mind is continuous, so we cannot change this experience right away. If you have the opportunity to go to the mountains and at the same time the mind is in the mountains, this is wonderful. But if you cannot do that, there are still opportunities. You can still get liberated. Especially, when we really consider transformation, sometimes when there are good qualities, you can transform even within a short time. Sometimes we say:\n\"Seven days of retreat with very good quality\nIs equal to maybe one year of retreat.\"\nSometimes it can become like that. I have seen that. Sometimes people do retreat and the mind is all over the world and they do not really know or they are not really engaged, so even if they finish long-term retreat, they have not changed much. But some people went to retreat for one week, and after one week they completely changed. So the quality matters. Time does not really matter, and the environment does not really matter.For me, when I was in retreat, for the first few months I was lazy and busy. Although my body was in retreat — my body was in the mountains — but my mind was not in the mountains. My mind was together with my panic and laziness and went around the world (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.) During these few months, I did not improve much. But later I really tried to put in an effort, only for a few days, and these few days really changed my life. I had panic, so I really practiced with the panic, I really put my heart into the practice, and these few days really helped.Do not worry too much about if you do not have the opportunity to go to the mountains. You cannot do it like Milarepa, but you can do it in a different way. You can make your home a mountain. You can make your city the mountain. You will have the opportunity to get liberated in your lifetime. To become Buddha within one lifetime might be quite difficult, be honest, but what we call, \"direct realization\" (is possible.) You can achieve direct realization in one life, which is wonderful, and many people these days are achieving that direct realization in one life. I have seen in my village, in Nubri, old grandpas and grandmas, their faces filled with a smile, and they are using prayer wheels (Mingyur Rinpoche pretends using a prayer wheel.) They say:\n\"If I die tomorrow, that is OK.\nIf I live long, that is OK.\"\nThey are full of joy. That is possible.","aliases":["Inspiration And Discouragement","inspiration and discouragement"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/inspiration-and-discouragement.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250378102,"sourceSize":5485,"sourcePath":"3.

When I was young, my mom would do bedtime reading. In my hometown — I was born in the northern parts of Nepal, right in the middle of the Himalayan mountains, our culture, lifestyle, and everything else, was just like in Tibet — we had an ancient lifestyle. For lunch, we would have a lot of food, but our dinner would normally be light — mostly we had soup. At dinner­time, our family got together around the fire — we made a fire which we sat around — most of the time it was my grandpa, grandma, mom, and me, and we all sat around the fire and we would drink the soup. Having finished the soup, my grandpa went to meditate, and my grandma, me, and mom were together. My grandma did not know how to read and I also did not know how to read at that time, so it was only my mom who knew how to read. She would read different books. Most of the time, she read Milarepa's life story — slowly, slowly. Sometimes, when Milarepa was facing problems, my grandma cried, then I cried, and in the end my mom cried — we cried, and cried. Then, we cleaned our eyes and began to read again — it was so nice! I really liked Milarepa's life style; to practice, to do retreat in the mountains — in the caves — I liked that.Later on, I learned meditation from my father. My father also did a lot of retreat. He did retreat for three years in Tibet. He put himself in retreat and he sealed the door. The toilet and everything was inside. There was only a small window from which he received the food. He did like this for three years.My other teacher, Saljay Rinpoche, did three­year retreat a few times. Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche, another teacher of mine, did formal retreat first, in Tibet, and later on he came to India and did wandering retreat. He went from place to place. Sometimes he mixed with the sadhus. His story is fantastic! It has really been an inspiration to me.When I was young, I grew up with these great masters around me. Although I had these panic attacks and it was miserable, I was inspired by the people around me. When I was thirteen years old I thought, \"I should do retreat.\" I was having these panic attacks, and these panic attacks was, normally what I call, \"following me like a shadow.\" When I was nine I learned to meditate. I did my daily practice and I did not do retreat until I was thirteen — before that I never did retreat. When I did my daily practice, it sometimes helped, sometimes not, it was on and off. But sometimes I even forgot to do daily practice. It was really difficult to keep it up continuously, so when I was thirteen I thought, \"I am going to go to do retreat for three years. This will be good for me. My laziness will not be there, so I can be free of my panic.\"Then I went to retreat. But, at first, my panic got worse, because my laziness followed me into retreat. So, I was in the gym, but I was not doing any exercise. (Laughs.) Then, my panic got worse. Later on, I really tried my best to follow the retreat schedule. When I followed the retreat schedule, I really applied my meditation with the panic. I accepted my panic and continued to do so. Then, later on my panic my best friend and my teacher. I think that was because of my retreat. It really helped me. It changed my life. Retreat changed my life.After that, I have been quite happy. I am not saying I did not have any panic again, I did, but even when I had panic, it was not a panic attack, but sometimes you feel fear, everybody feels fear, right? When I felt panic, I remembered my meditation practice, and it really helped me. If I would not have done retreat, perhaps I may not have completely transformed like that. So, for me, retreat is really important. That has impacted my life. It completely changed my life. Therefore, sometimes I recommend people to do retreat; but, to do retreat with good quality is really important. Even if you do daily practice for one hour, trying to fully practice for one hour, will really make a change and be of benefit.Nowadays, some people do retreat for a long time, but they do not know how to gradually develop the experience of retreat, so they push it — just like I did. I suddenly went into retreat, and my laziness came back in the retreat, and my panic became worse.Therefore, if you do a good quality retreat — even for one week — it may change your entire life experience. Therefore, it has been of real impact to me, and I hope it will be for you to. Also, do not worry if you cannot do long retreats, but try to do good quality retreats — even for two days — and it may change your life.","aliases":["My Inspirations","my inspirations"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/my-inspirations.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250456646,"sourceSize":4934,"sourcePath":"3.

If your motivation is to transform yourself and then help others, give a positive influence to your friends, family, society, world, etc., if you have that kind of motivation, retreat is really meaningful. If you really want to transform the world, first you need to transform yourself. Without transforming yourself, you cannot transform the world.When we look at the history of the world, the dictators did not want to transform themselves, they wanted to transform the world, they wanted to change the world, they wanted to change other, therefore, there have been wars in the past. They wanted to control everything.The first time I went abroad, before the plane took off, I saw a short presentation, and they said that before you have put the oxygen mask on yourself do not help others. First, help yourself, put on your oxygen mask, and then help others. \"Why is that?\" I thought. \"Why is this important?\" So, I asked some other people, and they said, \"If you try to put on the oxygen mask on others first, who knows, you might neither help yourself nor others? Because you might run out of breath before having helped others. So, in the end, both lose. First, you help yourself, and then you have the energy to help others.\" I thought this was a really good example.If we really want to have a deeper effect on the world, then we really need to try to transform deep within ourselves. If you transform, you may influence, let us say, two people. First one person, then two persons. If you transform one or two people, that can help another one or two people. That one or two people can help others, so in the end, we can transform the world. Why? Because we are all part of ripples. In the beginning, the ripples are tiny, not big, but then, as the wave goes, it becomes bigger and bigger and bigger. With anything unique, anything special, the influence becomes very big.The first time I went to America, they used American slang. In America, many people were using this slang, but in Canada, no one knew about this slang. Six months later, I went to Canada again and everybody was using this slang! Then I asked them, \"Where did you get this slang from?\" It was not on television, it was not on the news, it was not on some particular advertisement. They said it was, \"the word of mouth.\" Because it was unique and something special it spread out a lot. If you really transform yourself, if you yourself becomes unique and genuine, that becomes very powerful and it will benefit others.In Tibet, we say, \"Between saying a hundred things and doing one, doing one is more powerful than saying a hundred things.\" The meaning is that if you tell everyone, \"You should do this, you should do that...\" but you yourself do the opposite, you do not do what you say, then whatever you say do not have any value. It will not really benefit others. But if you really do it. If you are embodying whatever you are saying, then even if you say just one word, the influence becomes very strong and will benefit others. Therefore, retreat is not an escape. Actually, if you know, retreat is very important, valuable, and it is really the way to benefit othersFor example, Milarepa — the great Tibetan saint. He is similar to a saint, like a great Indian mahasiddha. For me, Milarepa is my hero. When I was young, my mom, me, and my grandma all got together around the fire and we drank soup. After finishing the soup, my mom read books about the life of Milarepa. My grandma liked the Tibetan folktales, and I liked Milarepa, so sometimes we argued a little bit. My mom sometimes read the folktales and stories, and sometimes she read the Milarepa’s life story. In the life story of Milarepa, Milarepa finished doing a retreat for many years, and after many years Milarepa had great realization. Then Milarepa thought, \"OK. Now, this is the time for me to teach. I should build a monastery, or I should build a meditation community.\" something like that. Then Milarepa had a vision of his teacher, who said, \"Do not make a monastery. Do not make a particular institution of meditation. Do continuous retreat. Doing retreat, is one of the best ways to benefit future beings in Tibet.\"The life story of Milarepa has been the biggest inspiration in Tibet, also for me. All Tibetan masters and many lay people — boys, girls, men, women — everybody is inspired by Milarepa's love, kindness, compassion, diligence, and insight. Therefore, doing retreat is a very precious and valuable thing to do in the world. You have to recognize this. You have to appreciate that. Then it will really become meaningful to you, and meaningful to others.","aliases":["Retreat Is Not An Escape","retreat is not an escape"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/retreat-is-not-an-escape.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250461726,"sourceSize":5082,"sourcePath":"3.

With these four, the key point is that we should do our best to stay focused on the practice, especially when we are on retreat.\nIn order to prioritize practice, we need to change our habits.\nThe time and environment of practice does not really matter. What matters is the quality of the practice.\nA few days of sincere, heartfelt practice in retreat can be life-changing.\nIf you cannot go to the mountains, make the city your mountain.\nIn the beginning, it is important to do short retreats.\nBy doing short retreats you will build up experience.\nExample: Changing the Direction of a Train\nIf a train goes forward very fast and you would like to change the direction, first, you need to slow down.

The biggest challenges in retreat are internal.\nThe biggest internal challenge is the waterfall experience: the experience of agitated thoughts and intense emotions.\nFirst, recognize the waterfall experience. Secondly, appreciate it.\nWe are attached to our unhappy situation, not because we particularly like it, but because it is familiar.\nFeeling uncomfortable in retreat does not mean that something is wrong; it means that you are perfectly normal — this is what happens when we make changes to our environment.\nYou can use your sense of discomfort or loneliness in three ways: As a support for awareness\nAs a support for loving-kindness and compassion\nAs a support for emptiness Do not expect your difficult emotions to disappear right away. They will come back again, but slowly their power over you will diminish.\nTry to appreciate the challenges you experience in retreat as opportunities to learn and grow. Energy movement are related to four things, two of which are deceptive and two of which are not: Sensory distortions — False\nSensing energy — False\nEmotions are going up and down — True\nPhysical body sensations — True Do not take having visions of Buddhas, hearing special messages etc. to be true; simply view them as you would a movie.\nWhen energy movement occurs, simply know that you are not enlightened and you are not crazy. It is just energy movement taking place.\nMeditate for short times, many times and also do walking and standing meditation.\n","aliases":["The Challenges Of Retreat, Summary Of Key Points","the challenges of retreat, summary of key points","summary of the key points"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Meditation Experiences","level":2,"id":"Meditation_Experiences_0"},{"heading":"Inspiration and Discouragement","level":2,"id":"Inspiration_and_Discouragement_0"},{"heading":"Common Pitfalls in Retreat","level":2,"id":"Common_Pitfalls_in_Retreat_0"},{"heading":"Common Retreat Challenges","level":2,"id":"Common_Retreat_Challenges_0"},{"heading":"Energy Movement","level":2,"id":"Energy_Movement_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/the-challenges-of-retreat-summary-of-key-points.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250472927,"sourceSize":4579,"sourcePath":"3.

One is what we call, \"formal meditation,\" and the second is \"informal meditation.\" Formal meditation means that you spend your time fully with your practice. Maybe you let go of your phone, you do not watch television, you do not communicate with others, you sit on your cushion, and your mind, body, and speech are fully dedicated to the meditation. If you do that, meditation develops very fast and it really gives you the best quality of your meditation. It improves your meditation a lot.The other one is informal meditation. The first important point is that you need to develop your meditation with formal meditation. Then, to exercise and to deepen the formal meditation with different circumstances, with different situations, you need informal meditation. With informal meditation, you can meditate everywhere, anytime, and under any circumstances — while you are talking, walking, in all places.Which one is important to do first? Formal meditation is important to do first. Formal meditation is like this: If you want to make a fire, first you need to have the right circumstances. You need tiny splinters of wood or grass, and then you can make a fire. Once the fire has become a little bit bigger, you can add more things. Once the fire becomes very big, you can add anything to the fire — big pieces of wood, strong wood, and other different things — everything you add helps the fire.Similarly, a retreat is kind of like extending the formal meditation. Of course, we do formal meditation everyday for one hour, twenty minutes, or something — which is great — but it takes time to develop your meditation this way. Instead, if you continue to maybe practice for two days, then one week, one month, one year, etc., with this unbroken continuation, will really help you to develop your meditation experience. It is like comparing having a part-time job and full-time job. If you work part-time, your achievements are less, right? But if you work full-time, there are a lot of benefits.Retreat is like being fully dedicated. And it is not only that, another benefit is the continuation — the benefit of the unbroken practice without being involved in other thoughts and emotions. For example: if you make a fire, when the fire becomes a little big bigger, if you then mix it with different circumstances, the fire will stay without not really developing. But, once the fire has really developed, if you then mix it with other circumstances it is okay, but doing it before that is quite difficult. Therefore, if we have the time, it is very important to do retreat.There are two benefits, right? The first is that you can fully spend time with your practice, and the second is the benefit of the unbroken continuation. There is also a third benefit. The third benefit is normally what we call — The causes of negative emotions, negative behaviour, negative habits, etc., all these come up because of three things: (1) The object is nearby, (2) the tendency in your mind, and (3) wrong motivation. When these three come together, negative actions may arise. One accumulate bad habits when all these come. So, we have the object and, also, deep in your mind you have not cut the root of negative emotions, plus, you have the wrong motivation.For example: When you are angry, if the person with whom you are angry is near you all the time — of course, you feel anger on the inside — and your motivation is, \"If I get the opportunity to fight with that person, I am going to do so.,\" when these three come together, you will fight, and hit each other. But, if you do not have anger on the inside, and the person is there, then the situation will not produce negative emotions for you. Also, if you do not have the wrong motivation, even if you feel anger and the object of your anger is there, there will not be a result. If the object is not there, then, even if you have the wrong motivation and anger inside of you, it does not produce a result.To cut this negative emotion, and to change motivation, is very difficult for a beginner. For a beginner, if you are away from the object and environment (of your negative emotion), it really gives you an opportunity to stay away from negative actions and all these things. Therefore, retreat makes you stay away from negative environments. While you are away from the negative environments, you transform on the inside and develop wisdom, compassion, and awareness. Then, anger begins to liberate and, at the same time, you are transforming the negative motivation, and later, even if the object is there, it will be fine. Therefore, the third benefit is that you are automatically away from the objects of negative emotions and negative behaviour — all those things.In brief, retreat is really, really beneficial, normally. If you can do long retreat would be very good! But even a weekend retreat — Saturday and Sunday — is great! Every month we have four weekends, right? Three weekends you can spend on holidays or whatever you want to do, and one weekend you can do retreat. Therefore, even a two-days retreat will be really beneficial for you in order to boost your meditation experience.","aliases":["The Importance Of Retreat","the importance of retreat"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/the-importance-of-retreat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250475653,"sourceSize":5543,"sourcePath":"3.

We make these offerings to the enlightened beings in many practices — in the Vajrasattva practice, guru yoga, and a lot of other practices. The enlightened beings do not want or need these things. We make offerings for our own benefit, to accumulate great merit and wisdom.Enlightenment, buddhahood, is achieved through the two great qualities — accumulation and purification. As you know, the Buddha has limitless qualities, which were gained through the great accumulations and purifications. Our offerings are a simple way to accumulate both merit and wisdom.Water To Cleanse The Mouth Or Face (Argham) – AuspiciousnessIt signifies auspiciousness or all the positive causes and conditions which bring positive effects. So, make an offering of water which is clean, fresh, cool, smooth, light, delicious, comfortable to the throat and stomach — these qualities are the qualities of auspiciousness. When you drink that kind of water, it is healthy; if you take a shower with it, it is healthy. While you make this kind of water offering to the enlightened beings, visualize an ocean of water.Then we dedicate this water to become a cause for all sentient beings to also collect positive causes and conditions. This is the first water offering — to cleanse the mouth or face.Water to Wash The Feet (Padyam) - PurificationThis is clear water mixed with incense or sandalwood which is made as an offering to all enlightened beings' feet. The symbolic meaning is purification. By cleansing the feet of the enlightened beings, we cleanse all our own negative karma and obscurations. By making offerings to clean the enlightened beings feet, we are really cleaning the \"feet\" of our own mind.With respect, devotion and confidence, we offer an ocean of this kind of water to all enlightened beings to purify all the temporary obscurations of ourselves and all sentient beings. Obscurations are called \"temporary\" because they can be purified. If they were permanent, we could not purify them even if we make an effort. So meditate on this when you make these offeringsAll the different types of obscurations — gross, subtle, negative karma, afflictive emotions, and obscurations to enlightenment — all these different types of obscurations become fully purified.Flowers (Pushpe) - GenerosityNext is offering of a flower, the flower of the beauty of enlightenment. It signifies the practice of generosity and opens the heart. A flower is very beautiful; so you naturally want to keep it.But when you offer it to others, there is some special feeling in the mind. With that connection, make the offering and practice freedom from stinginess. Milarepa said there is no special practice of generosity if one is free from stinginess. Meditate on that by offering flowers, which signifies the practice of generosity.\n\"May all sentient beings\nAchieve the freedom and endowment\nOf a precious human life.\"\nFlowers are offered to the head of the enlightened beings, for them to wear on the crown of the head. Within the practice of generosity, we immediately think of giving wealth, giving fearlessness, giving wisdom — there are many different types of generosity.Usually, when we say generosity, we immediately think of giving wealth, but it is not only that. For example, giving fearlessness means giving life. If someone is afraid for their life, like drowning in water, and if you give them safety from the water, this is called, “giving fearlessness,” or “giving freedom from danger to life.”Giving wisdom is a very special kind of generosity. When we give teachings to someone who has no wisdom — who does not know what samsara is, what enlightenment is, or what the cause of suffering is — that is such a great gift. To help them understand \"Oh, that is samsara, that is enlightenment.\" It is such a great gift! So, offering a flower symbolizes generosity.Incense (Dhupe) - Discipline or Moral EthicsMoral discipline is one of the most important practices. In the West, maybe discipline and morality are a little bit different. What I mean here is that when we have good discipline, there is morality. Discipline is in the teaching of the dharma. For instance, it says, \"do this, this, and this. Sit like this, meditate like this.\" It is taught like discipline. So when we do that, it is good moral ethics; when we cannot do these things that are taught to be done, then there is no morality, no ethics.In Sanskrit, this is called, “shila.” Shila means, “coolness,” or “freshness.” When we have good discipline, it cools the mind free from suffering. When we stay in that position well, it relaxes the mind and frees it from agitation. All these disciplines are part of the process of progressing in our meditation practice. Unless these disciplines and moral ethics are there, it is not possible to achieve enlightenment.Therefore, Buddha gave these three teachings — moral ethics, samadhi and wisdom — called, “the three trainings.” These three trainings are very important. Wisdom or special insight comes from samadhi (meditation), the stability and strength of the mind. That kind of strength in the mind is based on discipline and morality. So they are all related to each other, are connected to each other, and depend on each other.Therefore, moral ethics is a very important aspect of the path. Incense, which is the nature of morality, makes offerings to the nose of the enlightened beings. The enlightened beings are not attached to smell, but to our purity. All people respect those who have kept moral ethics well. It does not matter who they are, they get respect because they are trustworthy and dependable. That kind of person gives a good smell, good odor, and people are attracted to that. not only people, but the qualities of enlightened beings are also attracted by that morality. It is their foundation/basis, like the ground which grows all the \"crops\" of the enlightened qualities.Light (Aloke) - PatienceFifth is light or a lamp, which signifies the stability and clarity of patience, the beauty which dispels all ignorance. The light offering is made to the eyes of all the enlightened beings, who see clearly without mistake. Some people feel patience is showing weakness or pessimism. But, actually, patience shows the strength and clarity of mind, which are based on wisdom and compassion.Without proper wisdom and compassion, one cannot practice patience. So light shows the strength of the mind, the clear, stable nature of the mind, achieved through the practice of patience. Because the mind is not disturbed by other forces, it has such great qualities: clarity knows what is to be done — what is necessary, and what is not necessary. That dispels ignorance.Patience can be practiced in all different forms, different ways, not just when people are faced with anger. For example, there is patience in dharma practice and study. First, this is based on wisdom, so we should have such wisdom to really know how dharma is, what quality it has, the depth and vastness of dharma, and how we can achieve these qualities. Seeing those great qualities, then we need patience to study and practice. When we have that, there is a mind of clarity, of stability.On the other hand, we should not be patient with our afflictive emotions. When we have anger, desire, jealousy, pride, do not practice patience with these! This is the wrong way to practice patience. Even if it is hard or painful, these are subjects to get rid of or purify; they do not do any good thing. Without sacrificing something, there is no chance that we will have peace and happiness. So no matter what kind of pain we face, what difficult circumstances we face, we have to go thru it. Even if we have to sacrifice this life, it is worthwhile to sacrifice.A lot of people commit suicide to get rid of all these afflictive emotions. They are overpowered by the afflictive emotions and they kill themselves. That is the wrong way to sacrifice this life. We have to sacrifice this life the other way around. Buddha said that if we have to lose our life to keep the moral discipline, it just finishes this life, but next lives will be higher and higher, better and better. But if we do it the other way around and sacrifice this life for the afflictive emotions, then we will go worse and worse.In Shantideva's text it is said that we should not commit suicide or give this body without much purpose. Rather, we should cherish this precious human life. An explanation is given. When a medicinal tree is a very small plant, it has to be protected in order to grow into a huge tree. If you pick it up when it is small, it will benefit only a few and then it is finished. But if you protect it well, with many fences, it will grow into a huge tree that will bring fruits, flowers, roots, leaves, branches for the benefit of many, many sentient beings.Similarly, we have a fragile mind at this time. We must protect this precious human life with all these antidotes, fences, and let it grow big. Then we can benefit many sentient beings. By the practice of patience, all the 112 major and minor marks of a Buddha will come. Of course, we should not expect it, but the result of patience is a healthy, good body, to which all people are attracted, which is respected and admired. All this comes from the practice of patience.Fragrance (Gandhe) - PerserveranceNext is the offering of perfume or the fragrance of saffron or sandalwood — all the different types of perfume. That signifies perseverance or joyous effort. Through that one quality, one develops all the qualities of enlightenment. Without perseverance, without joyous effort, nothing can be achieved. Even in samsara, we have to work so hard to achieve anything. A lot of people sacrifice a lot of things just for samsaric achievement. You sacrifice your life for your work; if you die, what will you do with your wealth? So now, see the other side — dharma study and practice. When we could make such a great effort to study and practice dharma, we have to sacrifice some little thing.It is said in Shantideva's text that studying dharma is the cause to freedom from suffering. To achieve ultimate enlightenment, ultimate happiness, why can’t we do that? Others in samsara , they even sacrifice their lives for their achievements, but that becomes a cause only for suffering.As flowers were offered to the eyes of enlightenment, perfumes are offered to the Buddha's mind, because perseverance is the heart of enlightenment. Perfect generosity, moral ethics, patience, samadhi, wisdom — these all depend on perseverance. Without joyous effort none of these can be accomplished, so it is the heart, the essence. Meditate that by this offering, may all sentient beings progress in their attainment of the qualities of enlightenment.Delicious Food (Naivedye) - SamadhiSeventh is the offering of delicious food, which has a lot of different tastes. The delicious, excellent quality of food signifies samadhi, which is a nectar or ambrosia to feed the mind. This is an offering to the tongue of the enlightened beings — the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Samadhi is also the source of all the siddhis, like clairvoyance.There are two different types of clairvoyance. Ordinary clairvoyance is usually from other lifetimes. The other type is special insight clairvoyance, which we achieve this lifetime through meditation practice. Flying in the sky, different types of miraculous power, these can all be achieved through samadhi, the virtuous one-pointed mind.The very stable mind, one-pointed, clear, calm, peaceful mind of samadhi becomes a basis to achieve all the enlightenment qualities. Food symbolizes samadhi because eating food maintains this body, and samadhi is a kind of food that maintains the mind as well as the physical body.When you achieve any kind of samadhi, it is the fruition of the effort you made before, and it can also become a path to get higher fruition. Generally, when we eat nutritious healthy food, it makes our health better. So if we have the nutritious food of samadhi, it keeps the health of the mind. It makes the mind healthy, clear, calm and peaceful. By making this offering of delicious food, may all sentient beings have the health which results from the samadhi food. May all sentient beings have the samadhi nature, quality.Musical Instruments (Shabdha) - WisdomThere are different types of instruments — cymbals, bells, guitars, lutes — all of these are offered. Their nature is wisdom, which makes an offering to the ears of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and all the enlightened beings.Sound represents wisdom, because wisdom is a special power of the mind which penetrates phenomena. Compassion is achieved through great wisdom; interdependence of all phenomena is realized through great wisdom. Of course, all phenomena have the nature of interdependence, causes and conditions, but sound is especially easy to understand. If you play a guitar, what does the sound depend on? It does not come just from the piece of wood, the string, not from the finger. So where does it come from? It comes from all these things. None alone is sufficient to produce the sound. That nature is called, “illusion.” We can hear the Sound, but it has no independent existence. So we should see all sound having that nature. It just comes and goes like an echo. That realization is wisdom, and through that realization we can attain supramundane quality.\nMay the wisdom, that quality of the supra-mundane,\nArise within the minds of all sentient beings\nAnd free them from all confusion and ignorance.\nMay they achieve enlightenment. edited from a talk by Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen Rinpoche (5/1/1993) <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/kkgroffr.htm\" target=\"_self\">https://sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/kkgroffr.htm</a>\n","aliases":["The Meaning Of The 8 Offerings","the meaning of the 8 offerings","The Meaning of the 8 Offerings","the meaning of the 8 offerings"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/the-meaning-of-the-8-offerings.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250478484,"sourceSize":14453,"sourcePath":"3.

At first, Buddha was a prince and his father was a very powerful king. The king was afraid that Buddha would not become his successor, so the king tried to treat Buddha very well, keep him in the palace, and provide Buddha with whatever he needed. But, Buddha was aware of everything and then he began to ask questions about life; \"What is the meaning of life?\" Buddha saw someone that was sick and someone who was aging — all those things — and Buddha renounced the palace and looked for many different teachers. He did some short retreats. He received teachings and then he did some short retreats. In the end, once Buddha had received all the teachings, he went to sit next to the river Neranjara. Buddha did retreat for six years continuously. After that, Buddha got this big realization. Then, Buddha went to sit under the Bodhi tree and achieved full enlightenment. So, retreat is very important.Since that time, all the masters who have achieved high level of realization have all done retreat. In the Kagyu tradition, from Telo (Tilopa), Naro (Naropa) — those are the Indian masters — they all did retreat. Tilopa did retreat for twelve years, and Naropa did retreat for many years. Then Marpa and Milarepa also did retreat in one place for twelve years. By doing retreat, they achieved full realization. Especially in the Kagyu lineage, retreat is really important.If you do retreat, then you can really develop your meditation experience very fast. Like Milarepa's main disciple, Gampopa. Gampopa came to see Milarepa. Gampopa was very learned. He had studied all the scriptures, Buddhist philosophy, and he also knew Tibetan medicine. He was what we call a, “tönpa.” Tönpa means \"professor.\" Gampopa himself was a professor, so he was very learned. He did some retreat for a few months and he got good meditation experience.Later on he came to Milarepa and he received deeper levels of meditation teachings. Milarepa spent his whole life in retreat, and next to Milarepa there was another cave in which Gampopa was, and Milarepa asked Gampopa to do retreat there. Gampopa had a lot of different levels of experience. Gampopa stayed like this with Milarepa for three years, and within these three years, roughly 85% of the time Gampopa spent in retreat.In the end, Milarepa said, \"OK. Now I have taught you everything — all the important teachings from my teacher — so our lineage has passed down to you. Now, go back to your hometown and do retreat. Near your hometown, there is a mountain called, ‘Gampo mountain,’ you should go there and do retreat.\" Gampopa became a little bit sad. He really wanted to be with Milarepa, but Milarepa had asked him to go back. It was OK. Gampopa accepted and then Milarepa escorted Gampopa. Then, there was a bridge — a stone bridge — and a small river, and Milarepa sat next to the bridge on a rock. Then he spoke his final words to Gampopa. Milarepa said, \"You came here and received all these teachings, and now you should go. I gave you all the teachings, everything, except one — the most important one I have not given you yet. This teaching is too precious, so I will not give it to you. Other than that, you have received everything, so now you can go.\" Gampopa became a little bit sad. But anyway, Gampopa said goodbye, crossed the bridge, and went far away. Then, from far away Milarepa was waiving his hand, \"Hello! Come back! Come back!\" Gampopa became happy and returned back. Milarepa said, \"OK. You are a very good student, so I will teach you the final one.\" Gampopa became very happy. He said, \"What should I do? Should I offer a mandala?\" This is the traditional way to request teachings. Milarepa said, \"There is no need. Instead, look here.\" and Milarepa showed his butt to Gampopa. Milarepa's butt had become like a monkey’s butt, because Milarepa had done retreat so long in the mountains without a proper cushion. He did not have a nice cushion, so he was sitting on the rocks, and Milarepa's butt became like a monkey's. It looked like a monkey’s butt. Then, Milarepa said, \"Why do you think my butt became like a monkey’s butt? Because, I sit and practice and practice, and do retreat. Therefore, my butt has become like a monkey's butt. Once you receive teachings, the most important teaching is practice — to do retreat, and practice and practice. Now, I have already taught you the last important teaching, so now you can go back.\" Then Gampopa said goodbye and went back to his hometown.Back home he met his colleagues — there was a lot of professors there from his past. They all said, \"Come here! Come here! You should teach this. You should study that.\" So, he stayed with them in the monastery and he forgot about doing retreat and meditating. After some time, his meditation started to go down. Then one day, he remembered Milarepa's words. So, he left everything. He went to that particular mountain that Milarepa had asked him to, and did retreat for about six years at first. In the end, Gampopa achieved high level of realization — he achieved enlightenment.Therefore, doing retreat continuously is very important. This is very important especially among the Kagyupas. In Buddhism in general it is important, but especially among the Kagyupas the role of retreat is very important.","aliases":["The Role Of Retreat In The Buddhist Tradition","the role of retreat in the Buddhist tradition"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/the-role-of-retreat-in-the-buddhist-tradition.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250480987,"sourceSize":5843,"sourcePath":"3.

In one way, it is like having a part-time job or full-time job. Another thing is that you can be fully dedicated. Therefore, daily practice is when you are doing a little bit everyday. It is slow, with a lot of interruptions and different environments around you. In the beginning, you cannot transform all of this into your practice — it is quite difficult. You will fail and practice, and then fail again. But, there is nothing wrong with this way — it is OK. At the beginning, to do very long retreats is not something that we normally recommend. First, you do daily practice. This is very important.Meditation is like doing physical exercise. Even if you can exercise full-time, you cannot exercise the whole day. Therefore, at first, daily formal meditation is very important. Maybe you can do a mini-retreat. It becomes a very manageable way to do retreat. This is for formal meditation.Once your formal meditation becomes quite good, you can sometimes do retreat. At first, you can do retreat for two or three days, then you can extend it to one week, and slowly you can begin to do longer ones — this way would be beneficial, it would be good.If you really spend time with the process, developing a habit, and you understand what retreat is, and you have this feeling of wanting to practice, then retreat is really of benefit. But, nowadays many people do retreat, but they do it suddenly, or they do not know exactly what they have to practice, so even though they do retreat, their minds wander all over the world. So, the time is gone, your body is in the retreat house but your mind wanders around the world. That kind of retreat is not of so much benefit. People did retreat for many, many years, but they did not change or transform. It is like you stay in the gym the whole day but you are not doing any exercise. You are just sleeping at the gym the whole day. Even if you spend six months there, it will not be of so much benefit. If it is that kind of retreat, then just doing one hour of full dedication to one's meditation, is of more benefit than doing a few months of retreat. Therefore, the quality of retreat is really important. If you have a good quality retreat, then it is really of more benefit than just doing daily practice.Normally, our daily practice is like a fire that starts a little bit, but then some interruption comes — it can be the wind, or having a block of wood that is too big so the fire cannot burn it, and sometimes the fire goes out, and then it starts again, a little bit. Doing it this way takes time. Daily practice is like that. But, this is important in the beginning. You learn from it. You fail, but you learn from it. Next time, you know how to start a fire better. So, you start it again, and again it goes out, but you learn more and more each time. Normally, this is what we call, \"Failure is the mother of success.\" But, if you do retreat, then the fire starts, and it burns while having the right protection, and it becomes bigger and bigger and bigger. Once the fire becomes bigger, having wind is OK, adding big blocks of wood is OK, or even if stones or different things fall in, it is OK. After that, what becomes important is informal meditation.Some people, after they have finished their retreat, they come down and they mix meditation with their daily life, they mix meditation with problems, they mix meditation with different circumstances, and they go to meditate with difficult persons — the object is there. When they meditate with rough and challenging circumstances, with their problems, then everything becomes part of their practice.Normally, we need two things: formal meditation, and informal meditation. These two need a bond between each other. If you just do daily meditation — both formal and informal — you still have this quality. It does not mean that if you do not do retreat for a long time, you will not get any experience — it is not like that. You will, but the experience is similar to the part-time job experience. If you continue to do good quality and unbroken continuous retreat, then it is really beneficial to you.I really like to do retreat. All my teachers have done a lot of retreats. It has been of real benefit to me. In the future, once you do retreat, after some time you will bring your retreat experience into daily life. Then, in the end, everything becomes part of retreat, because there will be no obstacles. Even bad situations, even bad environments, everything will transform. Therefore, doing retreat is like making a fire — it is just the same.","aliases":["The Unique Benefits Of Retreat","the unique benefits of retreat"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/the-unique-benefits-of-retreat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250482911,"sourceSize":5040,"sourcePath":"3.

These are represented by a statue, a book, and a stupa.The image of the Buddha is a symbolic representation of the enlightened body of the Buddha. This could be a statue, or a thangka. If you want to have a somewhat more elaborate shrine, Mingyur Rinpoche suggests that we include a White Tara image, or statue. This could be placed to the left of the Buddha (when facing the shrine). The Tara statue could be somewhat smaller than the statue of the Buddha.A text represents the enlightened speech of the Buddha i.e., the teachings of the dharma. The text used could be written in any language. It could be the Heart Sutra if you wish to represent all of the teachings of the Buddha, or it can be a particular text related to your practice. It could go in front to the left of the Buddha (when facing the shrine).A stupa represents the enlightened mind of the Buddha. This is typically placed to the right of the image of the Buddha. The stupa could also be somewhat smaller than the statue of the Buddha.Lamps or candles symbolize wisdom that eliminates the darkness of ignorance.Use seven bowls for the water offering. These could be metal (brass or silver) or glass. Start with fresh water every day. Place the bowls in a straight line, close together but not touching. The bowls should be filled up to the space of a grain's width from the top.The seven water bowls represent the “Seven Limbs of Offering”. Each offering bowl symbolizes one of the seven offerings (from left to right):\nProstrations Plant the seeds for attaining the qualities of enlightenment\nPurify karma of body, speech and mind\nCounteract pride Offering Overcomes miserliness\nAccumulates merit Declaration of misdeeds Acknowledgement of misdeeds\nOvercomes non-virtue\nPurifies karma Rejoicing in merit Overcomes jealousy\nEngenders sympathetic joy and appreciation Requesting the Buddhas to turn the wheel Counteracts wrong views Requesting the Buddhas to remain Plants the seeds that will ripen in Buddhahood Dedication of merit Seals merit\nOvercomes self-cherishing If you choose, when you fill the bowls you could recite the “Seven Limbs of Offering” (left to right):\n\"I prostrate to the Buddha, dharma and sublime sangha\nI make offerings with my body, speech and mind\nI confess all non-virtuous deeds\nI rejoice in the virtue of all beings\nI request the buddhas to turn the wheel of the dharma\nI beseech the buddhas not to pass into nirvana\nI dedicate all merit to all sentient beings throughout the three times”\nAnother symbolic meaning of the water bowls is that just as the moon’s reflection in the water is the same in each of the bowls, the compassion of the Buddha shines equally for all beings.Normally placed on a shrine as offerings to the senses of the Buddha. The flowers could be cut flowers placed on either side of the Buddha. If potted plants are used, they should be placed on the floor on either side of the shrine. You could use regular candles, or glass oil candles. The incense can be placed in an incense burner, a small bowl of sand on the floor, or a small stand in front of the shrine.When setting up a shrine for an empowerment, a Vajrayana feast, or if your daily yidam practice requires it, you will want to present the “inner offerings” on your shrine in place of the water bowls. The seven inner offerings are:\nWater to Cleanse Mouth or Face (Argham) - Auspiciousness\nWater to Wash the Feet (Padyam) - Purification\nFlowers (Pushpe) - Generosity\nIncense (Dhupe) - Discipline, Moral Ethics\nLight (Aloke) - Patience\nFragrance (Gandhe) - Perserverance\nDeliciouis Food (Naivedye) - Samadhi\nMusical Instruments (Shabda) - Wisdom\nA shrine is a symbolic representation of the Buddha, dharma and sangha, and an expression of our own inspiration and appreciation. A shrine reminds us of the three jewels. It has the power to tame and uplift a space where we gather with sangha friends to practice. A room with a shrine offers us place of inspiration and peace. Sacred spaces have been used in this way throughout time.On an inner level, we are drawn to emulate the three jewels. We go for refuge in the truth of the infallible three jewels symbolized by the objects on the shrine. Through creating this space and relating with the representations of the three jewels, we deepen our connection, our respect, and devotion.A shrine and a sacred space create the environment for the power and blessings of the three jewels and the lineage to manifest. Such an environment allows us to directly experience the sanity and wisdom symbolized by the shrine. This is not merely a psychological shift; rather, with the help of the symbolic power and wisdom represented by the shrine, we are actually able to invoke the mind of the lineage.At the end of the day, before or at sunset, empty the bowls one by one, dry them with a clean cloth and stack them upside down. Offer the water to the plants in your house or in the garden.\nHere's a lovely teaching on <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/How_to_Set_Up_a_Buddhist_Shrine\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/How_to_Set_Up_a_Buddhist_Shrine\" target=\"_self\">How to Set Up a Buddhist Shrine</a> - by Ven.

I will have a lot of time for peace and joy. And then, my meditation will develop very quickly.\" Ideas have a lot of fantasies inside. Is this the right kind of expectations? If you want to do retreat, should you have those expectations or not? My answer is, \"Not.\" These ideas are not so good ideas. Normally, we say that when you do retreat, at the beginning, good motivation is really important. \"I want to do retreat to be able to benefit. Of course, myself, and by helping myself, I will be able to help my friends, family, colleagues, society, the world, and all beings.\" That motivation is important. Do not think, \"I will be in retreat and it will be fantastic! I will transform right away, and I will have joy and peace and all these things.\" If you have these kinds of expectations and do retreat, then your retreat will not be so wonderful — you will be disappointed. Therefore, normally, we say, do not have too high expectations. Let go of these expectations.So, what should you expect? \"I will do this retreat...\" in Tibet, what we call, \"Tsam.\" As you enter this special boundary, 30% of negative actions will not happen, because you are away from the objects of negative emotions and actions, right? That is already great! You need to really appreciate even a tiny transformation, a tiny virtue, tiny things that are related to non-violence and other things, related with kindness and compassion — you just appreciate this. \"That would be good. As long as I am not making negative actions, as long as I am not on purpose harming others, that would be great!\" That is the kind of motivation. Just an appreciation of the basic things, and then go to retreat.Then, if you can do some things even better, you will have more appreciation, you will have more feelings of inspiration. You will not be afraid of this waterfall experience. In fact, the waterfall experience is a good sign. You have to recognize that the waterfall experience is a good sign. This is also a really important motivation when you begin to do retreat.If you do retreat together with many people, sometimes the monkey mind projects onto your friends and colleagues in the retreat. \"Maybe he does not like me today? Today he said, 'Huh huh! a little bit stronger than yesterday. That means that he is sending me some kind of signal that he does not like me.\" Or, \"My friend slammed the door, very strongly. I think he does not like me.\" These things might appear sometimes when you practice. But, these are part of the waterfall experience. Let it be, let go, and it will go away. You will have joy, peace, and the experience of clarity. After some time later, that will not last. Then, dullness, agitation, and these things come back again. It goes up and down, up and down. Eventually, it will become better, and better, and better. Therefore, have the right motivation, and when you do retreat do not expect too much, and do not give up.This is really important.","aliases":["What To Expect From Retreat","what to expect from retreat"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/what-to-expect-from-retreat.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250489054,"sourceSize":3376,"sourcePath":"3.

These are the three categories. When you have these positive experiences, what do you have to do? There are two things that are important: One, do not be attached to it. Secondly, appreciate it.When I learned meditation for the first time my father said:\n\"Do not be attached to meditation experience.\"\nThen I really tried to think about not being attached to my meditation experience. I was thinking about that a lot. When I meditated, as soon as I had some good meditation experience I got worried. \"Am I being attached? Oh. I am attached now. I should not be attached! What should I do?\" There was so much worrying. Then I asked my father, \"You said when meditating there are meditation experiences. When there are good meditation experiences I should not be attached but I cannot help being attached. It seems like there is always attachment around my meditation.\" I asked my father this, and my father said, \"What is your attachment?\" I told my father about my attachments and my father explained to me that there is a difference between appreciation and attachment. At that time, I was confused about being attached to my meditation and appreciating my meditation. When you have good meditation experiences you can appreciate it, that is not a problem. You can have gratitude towards your good meditation experience, appreciate your good meditation experience, this is very important, but do not be attached to it.What is the difference between attachment and appreciation? Attachment has two things: being related to permanence and being related to singularity. The meaning of permanence is that when you have this wonderful experience, you want to have the same experience again and again, and you might think, \"From now on, it will be like this forever.\" That is wrong expectations. That is what we call, \"Attachment to permanence.\"Sometimes when I meditated, especially when I got new meditation experiences, I felt so happy. At that time I thought, \"I think this is not just an experience, this is realization!\" Because normally I was looking for realization. Then I heard a lot about the qualities of realization;\n\"Realization is like space.\nMeditation experiences are like clouds.\nOnce you get realization it is never lost.\"\nOf course it is never lost, but realization does not have a \"taste.\" Meditation experience has a taste. The meaning of \"taste\" is that when you are meditating you feel so happy, like, \"Mmm... Aha! Oho!\" (Mingyur Rinpoche pretends to be blissful.) That is the experience. Realization is that you become like that. There is no taste. You become the taste, maybe. (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.)Anyway, in the beginning, we will have experiences. Experiences are good. There is nothing wrong about having experiences, whether that are good experiences or bad experiences, both are good, actually. Especially for realization, bad experiences are very good. Good experiences are good for inspiration, it is good for feeling appreciation and gratitude. But there is a danger also. The danger is that you might become attached to that good experience. Bad experiences are very good for developing realization, especially detachment. But with some people, we do not know if the bad experiences are similar to the good ones. We may get stuck in the bad experiences as well. We think, \"There is something wrong with me. I am bad.\" Especially, you might think that bad experiences are a problem to meditation, but they are actually not. Bad experiences are the result of meditation, it is the sign of meditation. It is what we call, \"waterfall experience.\" Therefore, there are plus and minus to both, but you have to know how to deal with that.With good experiences, do not be attached. The attachment to permanence means that you think, \"It will be like this forever. From now on, I will have no problem with my monkey mind.\" This is wrong. Do not be attached.Attachment has two things. One is permanence which is finished, and the second one is attachment related to singularity. Singularity means, \"This is the best!\" Some people think, \"I will be enlightened tomorrow! I think I have achieved a high level of enlightenment. If I share this with my teacher tomorrow, my teacher will be really happy and give me a special promotion (Mingyur Rinpoche laughs.) I am just kidding about the promotion, but you might think, \"I am enlightened. I am the best. I am number one. No-one else knows about this wonderful experience.\" This is the meaning of singularity. Do not think that this is enlightenment. Do not think that this is realization. It is not realization. It is not enlightenment. It is just an experience. But having this experience is really good. It is good for you in order to develop appreciation.Normally, we say, \"Experience is the sign of realization.\" We have an example of this: In the morning, before the sunrise, before the real sun comes out, a light comes, sunlight. Everything becomes bright and slowly everything gets a maroon sort of color. The light is not the sun but it is the sign that the sun is coming. Similarly, experience is the sign of realization. Therefore, before realization, we will have these experiences.How do we deal with these experiences? One important technique is to not be attached to it. What is the meaning of not being attached to it? Think that, \"This is an experience. Who knows, tomorrow it might be completely gone? It is impermanent. It is not enlightenment. But it is the sign of meditation.\" You can appreciate this. \"How nice! I have this wonderful experience.\" Feel gratitude. Then, these good experiences will become the cause to achieve direct realization in the future. Eventually, you will have a realization that is free from experience. Eventually, you will reach that state.","aliases":["Working With Positive Meditation Experiences","working with positive meditation experiences"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/working-with-positive-meditation-experiences.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759250492259,"sourceSize":6231,"sourcePath":"3.

This is simply because they have not recognized what they already have. Thus, aside from merely recognizing our own true nature, there isn't the slightest thing to meditate on. Recognizing the importance of this, I have passed my days feeling joyful and content, wandering through the mountains and valleys and staying here and there. From my heart, I sincerely encourage all of you to practice diligently in this manner as well.\"\n— Mingyur Rinpoche, while on retreat\nDedicated periods of practice in retreat have been a central part of the Buddhist tradition from the time of the historical Buddha. Retreat gives us the time and space to explore our experience and discover aspects of our own being that are difficult to connect with in everyday life. Retreat is not without its challenges, but those who make time for this transformative practice often find it an indispensable support on the path of awakening.The course includes advice on retreat from Mingyur Rinpoche and other contemporary teachers as well as traditional resources on retreat such as Jamgon Kongtrul's&nbsp;Retreat Manual, Dudjom Rinpoche's&nbsp;Mountain Dharma, and the&nbsp;Life of Milarepa.<br>The instructors recommend that participants obtain a copy of&nbsp;The Life of Milarepa&nbsp;in print or digital form as the book will be used throughout the course.

This could be a statue, or a thangka of Shakyamuni Buddha, White Tara, or any deity. This could be placed to the left of the Buddha (when facing the shrine).A text represents enlightened speech, the teachings of the Dharma. The text used could be written in any language. Typically, this text would come from the Prajnaparamita tradition, such as the Heart Sutra. It should be placed in the front, left of the Buddha (when facing the shrine).A stupa represents the awakened mind. This is typically placed to the right of the image of the Buddha. The stupa could also be somewhat smaller than the statue of the Buddha. Mingyur Rinpoche has said that if you use a picture of the Buddha or deity, a simple card with the Heart Sutra, and a picture of a stupa, this would be perfectly fine.If you wish, your shrine could include candles, water bowls, incense, and flowers. Mingyur Rinpoche has said that these are not essential, and that, if you do not have these, or want to take a simple approach, you could simply offer a plate with some fruit.Use seven bowls for the water offering. These could be metal (brass or silver) or glass. Start with fresh water every day. Place the bowls in a straight line, close together but not touching. The bowls should be filled up to the space of a grain's width from the top.The seven water bowls represent the “Seven Limbs of Offering”. Each offering bowl symbolizes one of the seven offerings (from left to right): prostrating, offering, confession, rejoicing in merit, requesting the Buddhas to remain, requesting them to teach, and dedicating the merit.Another symbolic meaning of the water bowls is that just as the moon reflection in the water is the same in each of the bowls, the compassion of the Buddha shines equally for all beings.These are also often placed on a shrine as offerings to the senses of the Buddha. The flowers could be cut flowers placed on either side of the Buddha. If potted plants are used, they should be placed on the floor on either side of the shrine. Lamps or candles symbolize wisdom that eliminates the darkness of ignorance. You could use regular candles or glass oil candles. The incense can be placed in an incense burner, or a small bowl of sand on the floor, or small stand in front of the shrine.When setting up a shrine for an empowerment, a Vajrayana feast, or if your daily yidam practice requires it, you will want to present the “inner offerings” on your shrine in place of the water bowls. The seven inner offerings are: water to cleanse the mouth or face, water to wash the feet, flowers, light, incense, food, and music.For more information regarding the symbolic meaning of the shrine, refer to the document \"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Understanding the Shrine\" data-href=\"Understanding the Shrine\" href=\"3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/understanding-the-shrine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Understanding the Shrine</a>,\" which can be found in the resource section.","aliases":["Setting Up A Shrine","setting up a shrine","Setting Up a Shrine"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche"],"headers":[{"heading":"Shakyamuni Buddha","level":4,"id":"Shakyamuni_Buddha_0"},{"heading":"Text","level":4,"id":"Text_0"},{"heading":"Stupa","level":4,"id":"Stupa_0"},{"heading":"Optional Shrine Items","level":4,"id":"Optional_Shrine_Items_0"},{"heading":"Water offering","level":4,"id":"Water_offering_0"},{"heading":"Flowers, Candles, and Incense","level":4,"id":"Flowers,_Candles,_and_Incense_0"},{"heading":"Inner Shrine Offering","level":4,"id":"Inner_Shrine_Offering_0"}],"links":["3.-retreat-course/additional-teachings/understanding-the-shrine.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/setting-up-a-shrine.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759272595916,"sourceSize":3511,"sourcePath":"3.

The guidelines and principles of retreat practice remain the same regardless of the length of retreat. During your retreat you will want to be alone. It’s best not to see or talk with anyone, or engage in distractions — using the internet, listening to the radio, etc. Try to maintain silence during the retreat. If possible, do the retreat in a place where you won’t hear people talking.The day is spent meditating, with a little time allotted for reading and contemplation. You could take a book for study and contemplation, or perhaps, a book to inspire you, such as a life story of a great meditator from the past. In general, your reading should support and inspire your practice. Reading and study are not meant to be the focus of a meditation retreat.On the first morning, take a few minutes to reflect on your aspiration for the retreat. You might contemplate the qualities that you would like to emphasize, or what you would like to learn from the retreat. You could open each day with an aspiration and close the day with a dedication.During the breaks you could spend time reading and contemplating. You could also choose to do something physical to stay fresh, such as stretching, yoga, or Tai Chi. If you’re in an isolated place, you could practice walking meditation.Start your first session with whatever opening liturgies are appropriate to the practice that you are doing. This could include, among others, the lines for taking Refuge and arousing Bodhichitta, the Four Immeasurables, and a lineage supplication. You can add whatever other liturgies that you choose, such as the Heart Sutra.End each session with a Dedication of Merit. You could also add whatever else you choose, such as long life supplications, aspirations, etc.It’s always best to decide on the schedule that you want to maintain at the beginning of the retreat and try to stay with it.Quote\n\"In a remote place, where the thought of death pierces the heart,\nThe retreatant, who has profoundly turned away from attachment\nDraws the boundary, giving up all concerns for this life,\nHence, his mind is not involved with the eight worldly dharmas\"\n— The words of Karak Gomchung, quoted often by Mingyur Rinpoche's father, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Retreat Schedules\" data-href=\"Retreat Schedules\" href=\"3.-retreat-course/retreat-schedules.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Retreat Schedules</a>","aliases":["Tips For Structuring A Retreat","tips for structuring a retreat","Tips for Structuring a Retreat","tips for structuring a retreat"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#type/note","#topic/religion/buddhism/Tibetan","#topic/meditation","#topic/meditation/how-to-meditate","#topic/meditation/retreat","#person/Yongey-Mingyur-Rinpoche","#person/Tulku-Urgyen-Rinpoche"],"headers":[],"links":["3.-retreat-course/retreat-schedules.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"3.-retreat-course/tips-for-structuring-a-retreat.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1733761686000,"modifiedTime":1759272595923,"sourceSize":2808,"sourcePath":"3.

This experiential approach focuses on recognizing the mind’s empty clarity, and then stabilizing this recognition until it becomes an uninterrupted flow of experience that is integrated with all aspects of life. It allows the meditator to use every thought, emotion, and perception as a gateway to the awakened nature of mind and to see every aspect of experience as an expression of buddha nature.In this module we will explore the fundamentals of the Mahamudra lineage, learning about the meaning of the term “Mahamudra” and the key points of Mahamudra practice. We will see that the term “Mahamudra” can be used to refer to the nature of reality, to a lineage of Buddhist practice that originated in ancient India, and also to a set of practical meditation instructions that guide the meditator to an experience of the mind’s true nature. We will also learn about the ground, path, and fruition of Mahamudra and the four points that serve as the foundation for Mahamudra practice.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qyn2fg87amafqpl987ohm/mahamudra-course-mahamudra-101-summary-key-points.pdf?rlkey=tyu5b3cfgd13q6xll050l9c0v&amp;dl=0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qyn2fg87amafqpl987ohm/mahamudra-course-mahamudra-101-summary-key-points.pdf?rlkey=tyu5b3cfgd13q6xll050l9c0v&amp;dl=0\" target=\"_self\">Summary of Key Points</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mahamudra Course Landing Page\" data-href=\"Mahamudra Course Landing Page\" href=\"4.-mahamudra-course/mahamudra-course-landing-page.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">← Course Landing Page</a>","aliases":["Module 1: Mahamudra 101","Mahamudra 101","Module 1 Mahamudra Course"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.

In the context of Mahamudra meditation, vipashyana helps us to recognize the empty clarity of the mind, and shamatha enables us to stabilize this recognition and integrate it with every aspect of our lives.In this module we will explore the unique presentation of shamatha meditation found in the Mahamudra lineage. Our exploration will introduce the different forms of shamatha practice, including the use of the breath, sensory objects, and other supports for awareness, as well as the practice of open awareness. We will also learn about the stages of shamatha meditation and important principles, such as tightening and loosening the focus of attention.<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/i7c31m2nf3e3ajxeew9b0/mahamudra-course-mahamudra-shamatha-summary-key-points.pdf?rlkey=rh19c34z8k2g5oc0y1cdwmmii&amp;dl=0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/i7c31m2nf3e3ajxeew9b0/mahamudra-course-mahamudra-shamatha-summary-key-points.pdf?rlkey=rh19c34z8k2g5oc0y1cdwmmii&amp;dl=0\" target=\"_self\">Summary of Key Points</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mahamudra Course Landing Page\" data-href=\"Mahamudra Course Landing Page\" href=\"4.-mahamudra-course/mahamudra-course-landing-page.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">← Course Landing Page</a>","aliases":["Module 2: Mahamudra Shamatha","Mahamudra Shamatha","Module 2 Mahamudra Course"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"1.

This lineage of practical instructions helps us to experience the radiant purity of awareness and to stabilize this experience and integrate it with every aspect of our lives. For centuries, teachings on Mahamudra have been passed down by some of Tibet’s greatest masters, including Milarepa and Gampopa.In this course, we will learn the most important principles and practices of the Mahamudra tradition. Our journey will be based on important texts from the Mahamudra lineage and video teachings from Mingyur Rinpoche on key points of nature of mind practice. The course will also include live webinars with Mingyur Rinpoche and Tergar instructors, discussion forums, an extensive Mahamudra workbook to deepen understanding and experience, and a range of other resources for study and practice.Throughout the Mahamudra course, we return to three familiar points of reference: understanding the view, gaining experience through meditation, and the application of our practice in everyday life. The discussion questions, reflection exercises, and meditation suggestions offered in the course workbook are designed to help you deepen your experience and understanding in these three areas.Each module of the Mahamudra course will provide teachings, readings and practice instructions on the fundamentals of Mahamudra. In the first three modules of the course, we progress from the essential meaning of Mahamudra to the practices of Mahamudra shamatha and vipashyana. In the last two modules, we will explore the nature of mind, the unfolding of experience along the path, and the stages of realization.Below is an outline of the course by topic and length of time spent on each topic during the course from September through March.\nModule 1: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mahamudra 101 - Module 1, Mahamudra Course\" data-href=\"Mahamudra 101 - Module 1, Mahamudra Course\" href=\"4.-mahamudra-course/module-1.-mahamudra-101/mahamudra-101-module-1,-mahamudra-course.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahamudra 101</a> (4 weeks)\n<br>Module 2: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mahamudra Shamatha - Module 2, Mahamudra Course\" data-href=\"Mahamudra Shamatha - Module 2, Mahamudra Course\" href=\"4.-mahamudra-course/module-2.-mahamudra-shamatha/mahamudra-shamatha-module-2,-mahamudra-course.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahamudra Shamatha</a> (4 weeks)\n<br>Module 3: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mahamudra Vipashyana - Module 3, Mahamudra Course\" data-href=\"Mahamudra Vipashyana - Module 3, Mahamudra Course\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mahamudra Vipashyana</a> (6 weeks)\n<br>Module 4: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Pointing Out the Nature of Mind - Module 4, Mahamudra Course\" data-href=\"Pointing Out the Nature of Mind - Module 4, Mahamudra Course\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pointing Out the Nature of Mind</a> (4 weeks)\n<br>Module 5: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Path and Fruition - Module 5, Mahamudra Course\" data-href=\"Path and Fruition - Module 5, Mahamudra Course\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Path and Fruition</a> (6 weeks)\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Mahamudra Course Landing Page\" data-href=\"Mahamudra Course Landing Page\" href=\"4.-mahamudra-course/mahamudra-course-landing-page.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">← Landing Page</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Introduction","level":2,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Course Overview","level":2,"id":"Course_Overview_0"},{"heading":"Course Modules","level":2,"id":"Course_Modules_0"}],"links":["4.-mahamudra-course/module-1.-mahamudra-101/mahamudra-101-module-1,-mahamudra-course.html","4.-mahamudra-course/module-2.-mahamudra-shamatha/mahamudra-shamatha-module-2,-mahamudra-course.html",".html",".html",".html","4.-mahamudra-course/mahamudra-course-landing-page.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"4.-mahamudra-course/mahamudra-course-overview.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759271628654,"modifiedTime":1759379623449,"sourceSize":3272,"sourcePath":"4.

Although there are diff tenses of the verbs in Tibetan, we'll focus on the most commonly used verb tenses and then gradually work w/ diff tenses as they come up.\nIt's important to note the use of honorifics, which are especially prevalent in Dharmic language where the speaker generally wishes to show reverence to teachers and enlightened beings in particular. Thus, you'll see many verbs in their honorific forms which are crucial to identify as they are distinct from their non-honorific counterparts. Let's learn to feel the strength of reverence and devotion when we encounter honorifics!\nWe'll be emphasizing the presence and distinct usage of volitional and non-volitional verbs, which will be explained later. For now, know that volitional means you have control/agency/effort to make the action happen, whereas non-volitional means actions that occur w/o our control/agency/effort. Ex: སྐོར་ to turn volitionally འཁོར་ to turn non-volitionally We can sometimes refer to these verbs as transitive/intransitive or causative/resultative respectively, although these labels don't always precisely match.
